<h2><a name="PREFACE_ELEVENTH_ED" id="PREFACE_ELEVENTH_ED"></a>PREFACE OF THE ELEVENTH EDITION.</h2>
<p>When the earlier editions of this book were published, I was aware of
  the existence of a collection of documents relating to La Salle, and
  containing important material to which I had not succeeded in gaining
  access. This collection was in possession of M. Pierre Margry, director
  of the Archives of the Marine and Colonies at Paris, and was the result
  of more than thirty years of research. With rare assiduity and zeal, M.
  Margry had explored not only the vast depository with which he has been
  officially connected from youth, and of which he is now the chief, but
  also the other public archives of France, and many private collections
  in Paris and the provinces. The object of his search was to throw light
  on the career and achievements of French explorers, and, above all, of
  La Salle. A collection of extraordinary richness grew gradually upon his
  hands. In the course of  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii"
  id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>my own inquiries, I owed much to his
  friendly aid; but his collections, as a whole, remained inaccessible,
  since he naturally wished to be the first to make known the results of
  his labors. An attempt to induce Congress to furnish him with the means
  of printing documents so interesting to American history was made in
  1870 and 1871, by Henry Harrisse, Esq., aided by the American minister
  at Paris; but it unfortunately failed.</p>

<p>In the summer and autumn of 1872, I had numerous interviews with M.
  Margry, and at his desire undertook to try to induce some American
  bookseller to publish the collection. On returning to the United States,
  I accordingly made an arrangement with Messrs. Little, Brown &amp; Co.,
  of Boston, by which they agreed to print the papers if a certain number
  of subscriptions should first be obtained. The condition proved very
  difficult; and it became clear that the best hope of success lay in
  another appeal to Congress. This was made in the following winter, in
  conjunction with Hon. E. B. Washburne; Colonel Charles Whittlesey, of
  Cleveland; O. H. Marshall, Esq., of Buffalo; and other gentlemen
  interested in early American history. The attempt succeeded. Congress
  made an appropriation  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix"
  id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> for the purchase of five hundred copies of
  the work, to be printed at Paris, under direction of M. Margry; and the
  three volumes devoted to La Salle are at length before the public.</p>
<p>Of the papers contained in them which I had not before examined, the most
  interesting are the letters of La Salle, found in the original by M.
  Margry, among the immense accumulations of the Archives of the Marine
  and Colonies and the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale. The narrative of La
  Salle's companion, Joutel, far more copious than the abstract printed in
  1713, under the title of "Journal Historique," also deserves special
  mention. These, with other fresh material in these three volumes, while
  they add new facts and throw new light on the character of La Salle,
  confirm nearly every statement made in the first edition of the
  Discovery of the Great West. The only exception of consequence relates
  to the causes of La Salle's failure to find the mouth of the Mississippi
  in 1684, and to the conduct, on that occasion, of the naval commander,
  Beaujeu.</p>

<p>This edition is revised throughout, and in part rewritten with large additions.
   A map of the country traversed by the explorers is also added. The name
   of La Salle is placed on the titlepage,  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg
   x]</a></span> as seems to be demanded by his increased prominence in
   the narrative of which he is the central figure.</p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, 10 December, 1878.</span> </p>
<p class="blockquot"> <span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;The
title of M. Margry's printed collection is
D&eacute;couvertes et &Eacute;tablissements
des Fran&ccedil;ais dans l'Ouest et dans le
Sud de l'Am&eacute;rique Septentrionale
(1614-1754), M&eacute;moires et Documents
originaux." I., II., III. Besides the three
volumes relating to La
Salle, there will be two others, relating
to other explorers. In
accordance with the agreement with Congress,
an independent edition
will appear in France, with an introduction
setting forth the
circumstances of the publication.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE_OF_THE_FIRST_EDITION" id="PREFACE_OF_THE_FIRST_EDITION"></a>PREFACE
   OF THE FIRST EDITION.</h2>
<p>The discovery of the "Great West," or the valleys of the Mississippi and
   the Lakes, is a portion of our history hitherto very obscure. Those magnificent
   regions were revealed to the world through a series of daring enterprises,
   of which the motives and even the incidents have been but partially and
   superficially known. The chief actor in them wrote much, but printed nothing;
   and the published writings of his associates stand wofully in need of
   interpretation from the unpublished documents which exist, but which have
   not heretofore been used as material for history.</p>
<p>This volume attempts to supply the defect. Of the large amount of wholly
   new material employed in it, by far the greater part is drawn from the
   various public archives of France, and the rest from private sources.
   The discovery of many of these documents is due to the indefatigable research
   of M. Pierre Margry, assistant  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg
   xii]</a></span> director of the Archives of the Marine and Colonies at
   Paris, whose labors as an investigator of the maritime and colonial history
   of France can be appreciated only by those who have seen their results.
   In the department of American colonial history, these results have been
   invaluable; for, besides several private collections made by him, he rendered
   important service in the collection of the French portion of the Brodhead
   documents, selected and arranged the two great series of colonial papers
   ordered by the Canadian government, and prepared with vast labor analytical
   indexes of these and of supplementary documents in the French archives,
   as well as a copious index of the mass of papers relating to Louisiana.
   It is to be hoped that the valuable publications on the maritime history
   of France which have appeared from his pen are an earnest of more extended
   contributions in future.</p>
<p>The late President Sparks, some time after the publication of his Life
   of La Salle, caused a collection to be made of documents relating to that
   explorer, with the intention of incorporating them in a future edition.
   This intention was never carried into effect, and the documents were never
   used. With the liberality which always distinguished him, he placed them
   at my  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span> disposal,
   and this privilege has been kindly continued by Mrs. Sparks.</p>
<p>Abb&eacute; Faillon, the learned author of "La Colonie Fran&ccedil;aise
   en Canada," has sent me copies of various documents found by him, including
   family papers of La Salle. Among others who in various ways have aided
   my inquiries are Dr. John Paul, of Ottawa, Ill.; Count Adolphe de Circourt,
   and M. Jules Marcou, of Paris; M. A. G&eacute;rin Lajoie, Assistant Librarian
   of the Canadian Parliament; M. J. M. Le Moine, of Quebec; General Dix,
   Minister of the United States at the Court of France; O. H. Marshall,
   of Buffalo; J. G. Shea, of New York; Buckingham Smith, of St. Augustine;
   and Colonel Thomas Aspinwall, of Boston.</p>
<p>The smaller map contained in the book is a portion of the manuscript map
   of Franquelin, of which an account will be found in the Appendix.</p>
<p>The next volume of the series will be devoted to the efforts of Monarchy
   and Feudalism under Louis XIV. to establish a permanent power on this
   continent, and to the stormy career of Louis de Buade, Count of Frontenac.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>The Spaniards discovered the Mississippi. De Soto was buried beneath its
   waters; and it was down its muddy current that his followers fled from
   the Eldorado of their dreams, transformed to a wilderness of misery and
   death. The discovery was never used, and was well-nigh forgotten. On early
   Spanish maps, the Mississippi is often indistinguishable from other affluents
   of the Gulf. A century passed after De Soto's journeyings in the South,
   before a French explorer reached a northern tributary of the great river.</p>
<p>This was Jean Nicollet, interpreter at Three Rivers on the St. Lawrence.
   He had been some twenty years in Canada, had lived among the savage Algonquins
   of Allumette Island, and spent eight or nine years among the Nipissings,
   on the lake which bears their name. Here he became an Indian in all  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg
   4]</a></span> his habits, but remained, nevertheless, a zealous Catholic,
   and returned to civilization at last because he could not live without
   the sacraments. Strange stories were current among the Nipissings of a
   people without hair or beard, who came from the West to trade with a tribe
   beyond the Great Lakes. Who could doubt that these strangers were Chinese
   or Japanese? Such tales may well have excited Nicollet's curiosity; and
   when, in 1635, or possibly in 1638, he was sent as an ambassador to the
   tribe in question, he would not have been surprised if on arriving he
   had found a party of mandarins among them. Perhaps it was with a view
   to such a contingency that he provided himself, as a dress of ceremony,
   with a robe of Chinese damask embroidered with birds and flowers. The
   tribe to which he was sent was that of the Winnebagoes, living near the
   head of the Green Bay of Lake Michigan. They had come to blows with the
   Hurons, allies of the French; and Nicollet was charged to negotiate a
   peace. When he approached the Winnebago town, he sent one of his Indian
   attendants to announce his coming, put on his robe of damask, and advanced
   to meet the expectant crowd with a pistol in each hand. The squaws and
   children fled, screaming that it was a manito, or spirit, armed with thunder
   and lightning; but the chiefs and warriors regaled him with so bountiful
   a hospitality that a hundred and twenty beavers were devoured at a single
   feast. From the Winnebagoes, he passed westward, ascended Fox  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg
   5]</a></span> River, crossed to the Wisconsin, and descended it so far
   that, as he reported on his return, in three days more he would have reached
   the sea. The truth seems to be that he mistook the meaning of his Indian
   guides, and that the "great water" to which he was so near was not the
   sea, but the Mississippi.</p>

<p>It has been affirmed that one Colonel Wood, of Virginia, reached a branch
   of the Mississippi as early as the year 1654, and that about 1670 a certain
   Captain Bolton penetrated to the river itself. Neither statement is sustained
   by sufficient evidence. It is further affirmed that, in 1678, a party
   from New England crossed the Mississippi, reached New Mexico, and, returning,
   reported their discoveries to the authorities of Boston,&mdash;a story
   without proof or probability. Meanwhile, French Jesuits and fur-traders
   pushed deeper and deeper into the wilderness of the northern lakes. In
   1641, Jogues and Raymbault preached the Faith to a concourse of Indians
   at the outlet of Lake Superior. Then came the havoc and desolation of
   the Iroquois war, and for years farther exploration was arrested. In 1658-59
   Pierre Esprit Radisson, a Frenchman of St. Malo, and his brother-in-law,
   M&eacute;dard Chouart des Groseilliers, penetrated the regions beyond
   Lake Superior, and roamed westward till, as Radisson declares, they reached
   what was called the Forked River, "because it has two branches, the one
   towards the west, the other towards the south, which, we believe, runs
   towards Mexico,"&mdash;which seems to point to the  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg
   6]</a></span> Mississippi and its great confluent the Missouri. Two years
   later, the aged Jesuit M&eacute;nard attempted to plant a mission on the
   southern shore of Lake Superior, but perished in the forest by famine
   or the tomahawk. Allouez succeeded him, explored a part of Lake Superior,
   and heard, in his turn, of the Sioux and their great river the "Messipi." More
   and more, the thoughts of the Jesuits&mdash;and not of the Jesuits alone&mdash;dwelt
   on this mysterious stream. Through what regions did it flow; and whither
   would it lead them,&mdash;to the South Sea or the "Sea of Virginia;" to
   Mexico, Japan, or China? The problem was soon to be solved, and the mystery
   revealed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the burghers of Rouen was the old and rich family of the Caveliers.
   Though citizens and not nobles, some of their connections held high diplomatic
   posts and honorable employments at Court. They were destined to find a
   better claim to distinction. In 1643 was born at Rouen Robert Cavelier,
   better known by the designation of La Salle.<a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> His father Jean and his
   uncle Henri were wealthy merchants,  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg
   8]</a></span> living more like nobles than like burghers; and the boy
   received an education answering to the marked traits of intellect and
   character which he soon began to display. He showed an inclination for
   the exact sciences, and especially for the mathematics, in which he made
   great proficiency. At an early age, it is said, he became connected with
   the Jesuits; and, though doubt has been expressed of the statement, it
   is probably true.<a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> </p>
<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE AND THE JESUITS.</div>
<p>La Salle was always an earnest Catholic; and yet, judging by the qualities
   which his after-life evinced, he was not very liable to religious enthusiasm.
   It is nevertheless clear that the Society of Jesus may have had a powerful
   attraction for his youthful imagination. This great organization, so complicated
   yet so harmonious, a mighty machine moved from the centre by a single
   hand, was an image of regulated power, full of fascination for a mind
   like his. But if it was likely that he would be drawn into it, it was
   no less likely that he would soon wish to escape. To find  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg
   9]</a></span> himself not at the centre of power, but at the circumference;
   not the mover, but the moved; the passive instrument of another's will,
   taught to walk in prescribed paths, to renounce his individuality and
   become a component atom of a vast whole,&mdash;would have been intolerable
   to him. Nature had shaped him for other uses than to teach a class of
   boys on the benches of a Jesuit school. Nor, on his part, was he likely
   to please his directors; for, self-controlled and self-contained as he
   was, he was far too intractable a subject to serve their turn. A youth
   whose calm exterior hid an inexhaustible fund of pride; whose inflexible
   purposes, nursed in secret, the confessional and the "manifestation of
   conscience" could hardly drag to the light; whose strong personality would
   not yield to the shaping hand; and who, by a necessity of his nature,
   could obey no initiative but his own,&mdash;was not after the model that
   Loyola had commended to his followers.</p>
<p>La Salle left the Jesuits, parting with them, it is said, on good terms,
   and with a reputation of excellent acquirements and unimpeachable morals.
   This last is very credible. The cravings of a deep ambition, the hunger
   of an insatiable intellect, the intense longing for action and achievement,
   subdued in him all other passions; and in his faults the love of pleasure
   had no part. He had an elder brother in Canada, the Abb&eacute; Jean Cavelier,
   a priest of St. Sulpice. Apparently, it was this that shaped his destinies.
   His connection with the Jesuits had deprived him,  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg
   10]</a></span> under the French law, of the inheritance of his father,
   who had died not long before. An allowance was made to him of three or
   (as is elsewhere stated) four hundred livres a year, the capital of which
   was paid over to him; and with this pittance he sailed for Canada, to
   seek his fortune, in the spring of 1666.<a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE AT MONTREAL.</div>
<p>Next, we find him at Montreal. In another volume, we have seen how an
   association of enthusiastic devotees had made a settlement at this place.<a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
   Having in some measure accomplished its work, it was now dissolved; and
   the corporation of priests, styled the Seminary of St. Sulpice, which
   had taken a prominent part in the enterprise, and, indeed, had been created
   with a view to it, was now the proprietor and the feudal lord of Montreal.
   It was destined to retain its seignorial rights until the abolition of
   the feudal tenures of Canada in our own day, and it still holds vast possessions
   in the city and island. These worthy ecclesiastics, models of a discreet
   and sober conservatism, were holding a post with which a band of veteran
   soldiers or warlike frontiersmen would have been better matched. Montreal
   was perhaps the most dangerous place in Canada. In time  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg
   11]</a></span> of war, which might have been called the normal condition
   of the colony, it was exposed by its position to incessant inroads of
   the Iroquois, or Five Nations, of New York; and no man could venture into
   the forests or the fields without bearing his life in his hand. The savage
   confederates had just received a sharp chastisement at the hands of Courcelle,
   the governor; and the result was a treaty of peace which might at any
   moment be broken, but which was an inexpressible relief while it lasted.</p>
<p>The priests of St. Sulpice were granting out their lands, on very easy
   terms, to settlers. They wished to extend a thin line of settlements along
   the front of their island, to form a sort of outpost, from which an alarm
   could be given on any descent of the Iroquois. La Salle was the man for
   such a purpose. Had the priests understood him,&mdash;which they evidently
   did not, for some of them suspected him of levity, the last foible with
   which he could be charged,&mdash;had they understood him, they would have
   seen in him a young man in whom the fire of youth glowed not the less
   ardently for the veil of reserve that covered it; who would shrink from
   no danger, but would not court it in bravado; and who would cling with
   an invincible tenacity of gripe to any purpose which he might espouse.
   There is good reason to think that he had come to Canada with purposes
   already conceived, and that he was ready to avail himself of any stepping-stone
   which might help to realize them. Queylus, Superior of the Seminary, made
   him a  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> generous
   offer; and he accepted it. This was the gratuitous grant of a large tract
   of land at the place now called La Chine, above the great rapids of the
   same name, and eight or nine miles from Montreal. On one hand, the place
   was greatly exposed to attack; and, on the other, it was favorably situated
   for the fur-trade. La Salle and his successors became its feudal proprietors,
   on the sole condition of delivering to the Seminary, on every change of
   ownership, a medal of fine silver, weighing one mark.<a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> He entered on
   the improvement of his new domain with what means he could command, and
   began to grant out his land to such settlers as would join him.</p>
<p>Approaching the shore where the city of Montreal now stands, one would
   have seen a row of small compact dwellings, extending along a narrow street,
   parallel to the river, and then, as now, called St. Paul Street. On a
   hill at the right stood the windmill of the seigniors, built of stone,
   and pierced with loopholes to serve, in time of need, as a place of defence.
   On the left, in an angle formed by the junction of a rivulet with the
   St. Lawrence, was a square bastioned fort of stone. Here lived the military
   governor, appointed by the Seminary, and commanding a few soldiers of
   the regiment of Carignan. In front, on the line of the street, were the
   enclosure and buildings of the Seminary, and,  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg
   13]</a></span> nearly adjoining them, those of the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, or
   Hospital, both provided for defence in case of an Indian attack. In the
   hospital enclosure was a small church, opening on the street, and, in
   the absence of any other, serving for the whole settlement.<a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>
<p>Landing, passing the fort, and walking southward along the shore, one
   would soon have left the rough clearings, and entered the primeval forest.
   Here, mile after mile, he would have journeyed on in solitude, when the
   hoarse roar of the rapids, foaming in fury on his left, would have reached
   his listening ear; and at length, after a walk of some three hours, he
   would have found the rude beginnings of a settlement. It was where the
   St. Lawrence widens into the broad expanse called the Lake of St. Louis.
   Here, La Salle had traced out the circuit of a palisaded village, and
   assigned to each settler half an arpent, or about the third of an acre,
   within the enclosure, for which he was to render to the young seignior
   a yearly acknowledgment of three capons, besides six deniers&mdash;that
   is, half a sou&mdash;in money. To each was assigned, moreover, sixty arpents
   of land beyond the limits of the village, with the perpetual rent of half
   a sou for each arpent. He also set apart a common, two hundred arpents
   in extent, for the use of the settlers, on condition of the payment  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg
   14]</a></span> by each of five sous a year. He reserved four hundred and
   twenty arpents for his own personal domain, and on this he began to clear
   the ground and erect buildings. Similar to this were the beginnings of
   all the Canadian seigniories formed at this troubled period.<a name="fnanchor_7" id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">LA CHINE.</div>
<p>That La Salle came to Canada with objects distinctly in view, is probable
   from the fact that he at once began to study the Indian languages,&mdash;and
   with such success that he is said, within two or three years, to have
   mastered the Iroquois and seven or eight other languages and dialects.<a name="fnanchor_8" id="fnanchor_8"></a><a href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
   From the shore of his seigniory, he could gaze westward over the broad
   breast of the Lake of St. Louis, bounded by the dim forests of Chateauguay
   and Beauharnois; but his thoughts flew far beyond, across the wild and
   lonely world that stretched towards the sunset. Like Champlain, and all
   the early explorers, he dreamed of a passage to the South Sea, and a new
   road for commerce to the riches of China and Japan. Indians often came
   to his secluded settlement; and, on one occasion, he was visited by a
   band of the Seneca Iroquois, not long before the scourge of the colony,
   but now, in virtue of the treaty, wearing the semblance  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg
   15]</a></span> of friendship. The visitors spent the winter with him,
   and told him of a river called the Ohio, rising in their country, and
   flowing into the sea, but at such a distance that its mouth could only
   be reached after a journey of eight or nine months. Evidently, the Ohio
   and the Mississippi are here merged into one.<a name="fnanchor_9" id="fnanchor_9"></a><a href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In accordance with geographical
   views then prevalent, he conceived that this great river must needs flow
   into the "Vermilion Sea;" that is, the Gulf of California. If so, it would
   give him what he sought, a western passage to China; while, in any case,
   the populous Indian tribes said to inhabit its banks might be made a source
   of great commercial profit.</p>
<div class="sidenote">SCHEMES OF DISCOVERY.</div>
<p>La Salle's imagination took fire. His resolution was soon formed; and
   he descended the St. Lawrence to Quebec, to gain the countenance of the
   governor for his intended exploration. Few men were more skilled than
   he in the art of clear and plausible statement. Both the governor Courcelle
   and the intendant Talon were readily won over to his plan; for which,
   however, they seem to have given him no more substantial aid than that
   of the governor's letters patent authorizing the enterprise.<a name="fnanchor_10" id="fnanchor_10"></a><a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The cost
   was to be his own; and he had no money, having spent it all on his seigniory.
   He therefore proposed that the Seminary,  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg
   16]</a></span> which had given it to him, should buy it back again, with
   such improvements as he had made. Queylus, the Superior, being favorably
   disposed towards him, consented, and bought of him the greater part; while
   La Salle sold the remainder, including the clearings, to one Jean Milot,
   an iron-monger, for twenty-eight hundred livres.<a name="fnanchor_11" id="fnanchor_11"></a><a href="#footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> With this he bought
   four canoes, with the necessary supplies, and hired fourteen men.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Seminary itself was preparing a similar enterprise. The
   Jesuits at this time not only held an ascendency over the other ecclesiastics
   in Canada, but exercised an inordinate influence on the civil government.
   The Seminary priests of Montreal were jealous of these powerful rivals,
   and eager to emulate their zeal in the saving of souls and the conquering
   of new domains for the Faith. Under this impulse, they had, three years
   before, established a mission at Quint&eacute;, on the north shore of
   Lake Ontario, in charge of two of their number, one of whom was the Abb&eacute; F&eacute;nelon,
   elder brother of the celebrated Archbishop of Cambray. Another of them,
   Dollier de Casson, had spent the winter in a hunting-camp of the Nipissings,
   where an Indian prisoner, captured in the Northwest, told him of populous
   tribes of that quarter living in heathenish darkness. On this, the Seminary
   priests resolved to essay their conversion; and an expedition, to be directed
   by Dollier, was fitted out to this end.  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg
   17]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">DEPARTURE.</div>
<p>He was not ill suited to the purpose. He had been a soldier in his youth,
   and had fought valiantly as an officer of cavalry under Turenne. He was
   a man of great courage; of a tall, commanding person; and of uncommon
   bodily strength, which he had notably proved in the campaign of Courcelle
   against the Iroquois, three years before.<a name="fnanchor_12" id="fnanchor_12"></a><a href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> On going to Quebec to procure
   the necessary outfit, he was urged by Courcelle to modify his plans so
   far as to act in concert with La Salle in exploring the mystery of the
   great unknown river of the West. Dollier and his brother priests consented.
   One of them, Galin&eacute;e, was joined with him as a colleague, because
   he was skilled in surveying, and could make a map of their route. Three
   canoes were procured, and seven hired men completed the party. It was
   determined that La Salle's expedition and that of the Seminary should
   be combined in one,&mdash;an arrangement ill suited to the character of
   the young explorer, who was unfit for any enterprise of which he was not
   the undisputed chief.</p>
<p>Midsummer was near, and there was no time to lose. Yet the moment was
   most unpropitious, for a Seneca chief had lately been murdered by three
   scoundrel soldiers of the fort of Montreal; and, while they were undergoing
   their trial, it became known  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg
   18]</a></span> that three other Frenchmen had treacherously put to death
   several Iroquois of the Oneida tribe, in order to get possession of their
   furs. The whole colony trembled in expectation of a new outbreak of the
   war. Happily, the event proved otherwise. The authors of the last murder
   escaped; but the three soldiers were shot at Montreal, in presence of
   a considerable number of the Iroquois, who declared themselves satisfied
   with the atonement; and on this same day, the sixth of July, the adventurers
   began their voyage.</p>

   The following is the <i>acte de naissance</i>, discovered by Margry
      in the <i>registres de l'&eacute;tat civil</i>, Paroisse St. Herbland,
      Rouen: "Le vingt-deuxi&egrave;me jour de novembre, 1643, a &eacute;t&eacute; baptis&eacute; Robert
      Cavelier, fils de honorable homme Jean Cavelier et de Catherine Geest;
      ses parrain et marraine honorables personnes Nicolas Geest et Marguerite
      Morice."</p>
   <p>La Salle's name in full was Ren&eacute;-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la
      Salle. La Salle was the name of an estate near Rouen, belonging to
      the Caveliers. The wealthy French burghers often distinguished the
      various members of their families by designations borrowed from landed
      estates. Thus, Fran&ccedil;ois Marie Arouet, son of an ex-notary, received
      the name of Voltaire, which he made famous.</p>
  <p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_2" id="footnote_2"></a><a href="#fnanchor_2"> <span class="label">[2]</span></a> Margry, after investigations at Rouen, is satisfied of its truth
      (<i>Journal G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de l'Instruction Publique</i>, xxxi.
      571.) Family papers of the Caveliers, examined by the Abb&eacute; Faillon,
      and copies of some of which he has sent to me, lead to the same conclusion.
      We shall find several allusions hereafter to La Salle's having in his
      youth taught in a school, which, in his position, could only have been
      in connection with some religious community. The doubts alluded to
      have proceeded from the failure of Father Felix Martin, S. J., to find
      the name of La Salle on the list of novices. If he had looked for the
      name of Robert Cavelier, he would probably have found it. The companion
      of La Salle, Hennepin, is very explicit with regard to this connection
      with the Jesuits, a point on which he had no motive for falsehood.</p>
   <p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_3" id="footnote_3"></a><a href="#fnanchor_3"> <span class="label">[3]</span></a> It does not appear what vows La Salle had taken. By a recent ordinance
      (1666), persons entering religious orders could not take the final
      vows before the age of twenty-five. By the family papers above mentioned,
      it appears, however, that he had brought himself under the operation
      of the law, which debarred those who, having entered religious orders,
      afterwards withdrew, from claiming the inheritance of relatives who
      had died after their entrance.</p>

New York.&mdash;Louis Joliet.&mdash;The Sulpitians on Lake Erie; at Detroit; at Saut Ste. Marie.&mdash;The Mystery of La Salle: he discovers the Ohio; he descends

<p><span class="smcap">La Chine</span> was the starting-point; and the combined parties, in all twenty-four
   men with seven canoes, embarked on the Lake of St. Louis. With them were
   two other canoes, bearing the party of Senecas who had wintered at La
   Salle's settlement, and who were now to act as guides. Father Galin&eacute;e
   recounts the journey. He was no woodsman: the river, the forests, the
   rapids, were all new to him, and he dilates on them with the minuteness
   of a novice. Above all, he admired the Indian birch canoes. "If God," he
   says, "grants me the grace of returning to France, I shall try to carry
   one with me." Then he describes the bivouac: "Your lodging is as extraordinary
   as your vessels; for, after paddling or carrying the canoes all day, you
   find mother earth ready to receive your wearied body. If the weather is
   fair, you make a fire and lie down <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg
   20]</a></span> to sleep without further trouble; but if it rains, you
   must peel bark from the trees, and make a shed by laying it on a frame
   of sticks. As for your food, it is enough to make you burn all the cookery
   books that ever were written; for in the woods of Canada one finds means
   to live well without bread, wine, salt, pepper, or spice. The ordinary
   food is Indian corn, or Turkey wheat as they call it in France, which
   is crushed between two stones and boiled, seasoning it with meat or fish,
   when you can get them. This sort of life seemed so strange to us that
   we all felt the effects of it; and before we were a hundred leagues from
   Montreal, not one of us was free from some malady or other. At last, after
   all our misery, on the second of August, we discovered Lake Ontario, like
   a great sea with no land beyond it."</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE SENECA VILLAGES.</div>
<p>Thirty-five days after leaving La Chine, they reached Irondequoit Bay,
   on the south side of the lake. Here they were met by a number of Seneca
   Indians, who professed friendship and invited them to their villages,
   fifteen or twenty miles distant. As this was on their way to the upper
   waters of the Ohio, and as they hoped to find guides at the villages to
   conduct them, they accepted the invitation. Dollier, with most of the
   men, remained to guard the canoes; while La Salle, with Galin&eacute;e
   and eight other Frenchmen, accompanied by a troop of Indians, set out
   on the morning of the twelfth, and reached the principal village before
   evening. It stood on a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg
   21]</a></span> hill, in the midst of a clearing nearly two leagues in
   compass.<a name="fnanchor_13" id="fnanchor_13"></a><a href="#footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> A rude stockade surrounded it; and as the visitors drew near
   they saw a band of old men seated on the grass, waiting to receive them.
   One of these veterans, so feeble with age that he could hardly stand,
   made them an harangue, in which he declared that the Senecas were their
   brothers, and invited them to enter the village. They did so, surrounded
   by a crowd of savages, and presently found themselves in the midst of
   a disorderly cluster of large but filthy abodes of bark, about a hundred
   and fifty in number, the most capacious of which was assigned to their
   use. Here they made their quarters, and were soon overwhelmed by Seneca
   hospitality. Children brought them pumpkins and berries from the woods;
   and boy messengers came to summon them to endless feasts, where they were
   regaled with the flesh of dogs and with boiled maize seasoned with oil
   pressed from nuts and the seed of sunflowers.</p>
<p>La Salle had flattered himself that he knew enough Iroquois to hold communication
   with the Senecas; but he failed completely in the attempt. The priests
   had a Dutch interpreter, who spoke Iroquois fluently, but knew so little
   French, and was withal so obstinate, that he proved useless; so that it
   was necessary to employ a man in the service of the Jesuit Fremin, whose
   mission was at this village. What the party needed was a guide to conduct
   them to the Ohio; and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg
   22]</a></span> soon after their arrival a party of warriors appeared,
   with a young prisoner belonging to one of the tribes of that region. Galin&eacute;e
   wanted to beg or buy him from his captors; but the Senecas had other intentions. "I
   saw," writes the priest, "the most miserable spectacle I ever beheld in
   my life." It was the prisoner tied to a stake and tortured for six hours
   with diabolical ingenuity, while the crowd danced and yelled with delight,
   and the chiefs and elders sat in a row smoking their pipes and watching
   the contortions of the victim with an air of serene enjoyment. The body
   was at last cut up and eaten, and in the evening the whole population
   occupied themselves in scaring away the angry ghost by beating with sticks
   against the bark sides of the lodges.</p>
<p>La Salle and his companions began to fear for their own safety. Some of
   their hosts wished to kill them in revenge for the chief murdered near
   Montreal; and as these and others were at times in a frenzy of drunkenness,
   the position of the French became critical. They suspected that means
   had been used to prejudice the Senecas against them. Not only could they
   get no guides, but they were told that if they went to the Ohio the tribes
   of those parts would infallibly kill them. Their Dutch interpreter became
   disheartened and unmanageable, and, after staying a month at the village,
   the hope of getting farther on their way seemed less than ever. Their
   plan, it was clear, must be changed; and an Indian from Otinawatawa, a
   kind of Iroquois colony at the head <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg
   23]</a></span> of Lake Ontario, offered to guide them to his village and
   show them a better way to the Ohio. They left the Senecas, coasted the
   south shore of the lake, passed the mouth of the Niagara, where they heard
   the distant roar of the cataract, and on the twenty-fourth of September
   reached Otinawatawa, which was a few miles north of the present town of
   Hamilton. The inhabitants proved friendly, and La Salle received the welcome
   present of a Shawanoe prisoner, who told them that the Ohio could be reached
   in six weeks, and that he would guide them to it. Delighted at this good
   fortune, they were about to set out; when they heard, to their astonishment,
   of the arrival of two other Frenchmen at a neighboring village.</p>
<div class="sidenote">LOUIS JOLIET.</div>
<p>One of the strangers was destined to hold a conspicuous place in the history
   of western discovery. This was Louis Joliet, a young man of about the
   age of La Salle. Like him, he had studied for the priesthood; but the
   world and the wilderness had conquered his early inclinations, and changed
   him to an active and adventurous fur-trader. Talon had sent him to discover
   and explore the copper-mines of Lake Superior. He had failed in the attempt,
   and was now returning. His Indian guide, afraid of passing the Niagara
   portage lest he should meet enemies, had led him from Lake Erie, by way
   of Grand River, towards the head of Lake Ontario; and thus it was that
   he met La Salle and the Sulpitians.</p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg
   24]</a></span></p>
<p>This meeting caused a change of plan. Joliet showed the priests a map
   which he had made of such parts of the Upper Lakes as he had visited,
   and gave them a copy of it; telling them, at the same time, of the Pottawattamies
   and other tribes of that region in grievous need of spiritual succor.
   The result was a determination on their part to follow the route which
   he suggested, notwithstanding the remonstrances of La Salle, who in vain
   reminded them that the Jesuits had preoccupied the field, and would regard
   them as intruders. They resolved that the Pottawattamies should no longer
   sit in darkness; while, as for the Mississippi, it could be reached, as
   they conceived, with less risk by this northern route than by that of
   the south.</p>
<p>La Salle was of a different mind. His goal was the Ohio, and not the northern
   lakes. A few days before, while hunting, he had been attacked by a fever,
   sarcastically ascribed by Galin&eacute;e to his having seen three large
   rattle-snakes crawling up a rock. He now told his two colleagues that
   he was in no condition to go forward, and should be forced to part with
   them. The staple of La Salle's character, as his life will attest, was
   an invincible determination of purpose, which set at naught all risks
   and all sufferings. He had cast himself with all his resources into this
   enterprise; and, while his faculties remained, he was not a man to recoil
   from it. On the other hand, the masculine fibre of which he was made did
   not always withhold him from the practice of the arts of address, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg
   25]</a></span> and the use of what Dollier de Casson styles <i>belles
   paroles</i>. He respected the priesthood, with the exception, it seems,
   of the Jesuits; and he was under obligations to the Sulpitians of Montreal.
   Hence there can be no doubt that he used his illness as a pretext for
   escaping from their company without ungraciousness, and following his
   own path in his own way.</p>
<div class="sidenote">SEPARATION.</div>
<p>On the last day of September, the priests made an altar, supported by
   the paddles of the canoes laid on forked sticks. Dollier said mass; La
   Salle and his followers received the sacrament, as did also those of his
   late colleagues; and thus they parted, the Sulpitians and their party
   descending the Grand River towards Lake Erie, while La Salle, as they
   supposed, began his return to Montreal. What course he actually took we
   shall soon inquire; and meanwhile, for a few moments, we will follow the
   priests. When they reached Lake Erie, they saw it tossing like an angry
   ocean. They had no mind to tempt the dangerous and unknown navigation,
   and encamped for the winter in the forest near the peninsula called the
   Long Point. Here they gathered a good store of chestnuts, hickory-nuts,
   plums, and grapes, and built themselves a log cabin, with a recess at
   the end for an altar. They passed the winter unmolested, shooting game
   in abundance, and saying mass three times a week. Early in spring, they
   planted a large cross, attached to it the arms of France, and took formal
   possession of the country in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg
   26]</a></span> the name of Louis XIV. This done, they resumed their voyage,
   and, after many troubles, landed one evening in a state of exhaustion
   on or near Point Pel&eacute;e, towards the western extremity of Lake Erie.
   A storm rose as they lay asleep, and swept off a great part of their baggage,
   which, in their fatigue, they had left at the edge of the water. Their
   altar-service was lost with the rest,&mdash;a misfortune which they ascribed
   to the jealousy and malice of the Devil. Debarred henceforth from saying
   mass, they resolved to return to Montreal and leave the Pottawattamies
   uninstructed. They presently entered the strait by which Lake Huron joins
   Lake Erie, and landing near where Detroit now stands, found a large stone,
   somewhat suggestive of the human figure, which the Indians had bedaubed
   with paint, and which they worshipped as a manito. In view of their late
   misfortune, this device of the arch-enemy excited their utmost resentment. "After
   the loss of our altar-service," writes Galin&eacute;e, "and the hunger
   we had suffered, there was not a man of us who was not filled with hatred
   against this false deity. I devoted one of my axes to breaking him in
   pieces; and then, having fastened our canoes side by side, we carried
   the largest piece to the middle of the river, and threw it, with all the
   rest, into the water, that he might never be heard of again. God rewarded
   us immediately for this good action, for we killed a deer and a bear that
   same day."</p>
<div class="sidenote">AT STE. MARIE DU SAUT.</div>
<p>This is the first recorded passage of white men <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg
         27]</a></span> through the Strait of Detroit; though Joliet had,
         no doubt, passed this way on his return from the Upper Lakes.<a name="fnanchor_14" id="fnanchor_14"></a><a href="#footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
         The two missionaries took this course, with the intention of proceeding
         to the Saut Ste. Marie, and there joining the Ottawas, and other
         tribes of that region, in their yearly descent to Montreal. They
         issued upon Lake Huron; followed its eastern shores till they reached
         the Georgian Bay, near the head of which the Jesuits had established
         their great mission of the Hurons, destroyed, twenty years before,
         by the Iroquois;<a name="fnanchor_15" id="fnanchor_15"></a><a href="#footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and, ignoring or slighting the labors of the
         rival missionaries, held their way northward along the rocky archipelago
         that edged those lonely coasts. They passed the Manitoulins, and,
         ascending the strait by which Lake Superior discharges its waters,
         arrived on the twenty-fifth of May at Ste. Marie du Saut. Here they
         found the two Jesuits, Dablon and Marquette, in a square fort of
         cedar pickets, built by their men within the past year, and enclosing
         a chapel and a house. Near by, they had cleared a large tract of
         land, and sown it with wheat, Indian corn, peas, and other crops.
         The new-comers were graciously received, and invited to vespers
         in the chapel; but they very soon found La Salle's prediction made
         good, and saw that the Jesuit fathers wanted no help from St. Sulpice.
         Galin&eacute;e, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg
         28]</a></span> on his part, takes occasion to remark, that, though
         the Jesuits had baptized a few Indians at the Saut, not one of them
         was a good enough Christian to receive the Eucharist; and he intimates
         that the case, by their own showing, was still worse at their mission
         of St. Esprit. The two Sulpitians did not care to prolong their
         stay; and, three days after their arrival, they left the Saut,&mdash;not,
         as they expected, with the Indians, but with a French guide, furnished
         by the Jesuits. Ascending French River to Lake Nipissing, they crossed
         to the waters of the Ottawa, and descended to Montreal, which they
         reached on the eighteenth of June. They had made no discoveries
         and no converts; but Galin&eacute;e, after his arrival, made the
         earliest map of the Upper Lakes known to exist.<a name="fnanchor_16" id="fnanchor_16"></a><a href="#footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE'S DISCOVERIES.</div>
<p>We return now to La Salle, only to find ourselves involved in mist and
   obscurity. What did he do after he left the two priests? Unfortunately,
   a definite answer is not possible; and the next two years of his life
   remain in some measure an enigma. That he was busied in active exploration,
   and that he made important discoveries, is certain; but the extent and
   character of these discoveries remain wrapped in doubt. He is known to
   have kept journals and made maps; and these were in existence, and in
   possession of his niece, Madeleine Cavelier, then in advanced <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg
   29]</a></span> age, as late as the year 1756; beyond which time the most
   diligent inquiry has failed to trace them. Abb&eacute; Faillon affirms
   that some of La Salle's men, refusing to follow him, returned to La Chine,
   and that the place then received its name, in derision of the young adventurer's
   dream of a westward passage to China.<a name="fnanchor_17" id="fnanchor_17"></a><a href="#footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> As for himself, the only distinct
   record of his movements is that contained in a paper, entitled "Histoire
   de Monsieur de la Salle." It is an account of his explorations, and of
   the state of parties in Canada previous to the year 1678,&mdash;taken
   from the lips of La Salle himself, by a person whose name does not appear,
   but who declares that he had ten or twelve conversations with him at Paris,
   whither he had come with a petition to the Court. The writer himself had
   never been in America, and was ignorant of its geography; hence blunders
   on his part might reasonably be expected. His statements, however, are
   in some measure intelligible; and the following is the substance of them.</p>
<p>After leaving the priests, La Salle went to Onondaga, where we are left
   to infer that he succeeded better in getting a guide than he had before
   done among the Senecas. Thence he made his way to a point six or seven
   leagues distant from Lake Erie, where he reached a branch of the Ohio,
   and, descending it, followed the river as far as the rapids at Louisville,&mdash;or,
   as has been maintained, beyond <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg
   30]</a></span> its confluence with the Mississippi. His men now refused
   to go farther, and abandoned him, escaping to the English and the Dutch;
   whereupon he retraced his steps alone.<a name="fnanchor_18" id="fnanchor_18"></a><a href="#footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> This must have been in the
   winter of 1669-70, or in the following spring; unless there is an error
   of date in the statement of Nicolas Perrot, the famous <i>voyageur</i>,
   who says that he met him in the summer of 1670, hunting on the Ottawa
   with a party of Iroquois.<a name="fnanchor_19" id="fnanchor_19"></a><a href="#footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">THE RIVER ILLINOIS.</div>
<p>But how was La Salle employed in the following year? The same memoir has
   its solution to the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg
   31]</a></span> problem. By this it appears that the indefatigable explorer
   embarked on Lake Erie, ascended the Detroit to Lake Huron, coasted the
   unknown shores of Michigan, passed the Straits of Michilimackinac, and,
   leaving Green Bay behind him, entered what is described as an incomparably
   larger bay, but which was evidently the southern portion of Lake Michigan.
   Thence he crossed to a river flowing westward,&mdash;evidently the Illinois,&mdash;and
   followed it until it was joined by another river flowing from the northwest
   to the southeast. By this, the Mississippi only can be meant; and he is
   reported to have said that he descended it to the thirty-sixth degree
   of latitude; where he stopped, assured that it discharged itself not into
   the Gulf of California, but into the Gulf of Mexico, and resolved to follow
   it thither at a future day, when better provided with men and supplies.<a name="fnanchor_20" id="fnanchor_20"></a><a href="#footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">THE MISSISSIPPI.</div>
<p>The first of these statements,&mdash;that relating to the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg
         32]</a></span> Ohio,&mdash;confused, vague, and in great part incorrect,
         as it certainly is, is nevertheless well sustained as regards one
         essential point. La Salle himself, in a memorial addressed to Count
         Frontenac in 1677, affirms that he discovered the Ohio, and descended
         it as far as to a fall which obstructed it.<a name="fnanchor_21" id="fnanchor_21"></a><a href="#footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Again, his rival,
         Louis Joliet, whose testimony on this point cannot be suspected,
         made two maps of the region of the Mississippi and the Great Lakes.
         The Ohio is laid down on both of them, with an inscription to the
         effect that it had been explored by La Salle.<a name="fnanchor_22" id="fnanchor_22"></a><a href="#footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> That <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg
         33]</a></span> he discovered the Ohio may then be regarded as established.
         That he descended it to the Mississippi, he himself does not pretend;
         nor is there reason to believe that he did so.</p>
<p>With regard to his alleged voyage down the Illinois, the case is different.
   Here, he is reported to have made a statement which admits but one interpretation,&mdash;that
   of the discovery by him of the Mississippi prior to its discovery by Joliet
   and Marquette. This statement is attributed to a man not prone to vaunt
   his own exploits, who never proclaimed them in print, and whose testimony,
   even in his own case, must therefore have weight. But it comes to us through
   the medium of a person strongly biassed in favor of La Salle, and against
   Marquette and the Jesuits.</p>
<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE'S DISCOVERIES.</div>
<p>Seven years had passed since the alleged discovery, and La Salle had not
   before laid claim to it; although it was matter of notoriety that during
   five years it had been claimed by Joliet, and that his claim was generally
   admitted. The correspondence of the governor and the intendant is silent
   as to La Salle's having penetrated to the Mississippi, though the attempt
   was made under the auspices of the latter, as his own letters declare;
   while both had the discovery of the great river earnestly at heart. The
   governor, Frontenac, La Salle's ardent supporter and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg
   34]</a></span> ally, believed in 1672, as his letters show, that the Mississippi
   flowed into the Gulf of California; and, two years later, he announces
   to the minister Colbert its discovery by Joliet.<a name="fnanchor_23" id="fnanchor_23"></a><a href="#footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> After La Salle's
   death, his brother, his nephew, and his niece addressed a memorial to
   the king, petitioning for certain grants in consideration of the discoveries
   of their relative, which they specify at some length; but they do not
   pretend that he reached the Mississippi before his expeditions of 1679
   to 1682.<a name="fnanchor_24" id="fnanchor_24"></a><a href="#footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> This silence is the more significant, as it is this very
   niece who had possession of the papers in which La Salle recounts the
   journeys of which the issues are in question.<a name="fnanchor_25" id="fnanchor_25"></a><a href="#footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg
   35]</a></span> Had they led him to the Mississippi, it is reasonably certain
   that she would have made it known in her memorial. La Salle discovered
   the Ohio, and in all probability the Illinois also; but that he discovered
   the Mississippi has not been proved, nor, in the light of the evidence
   we have, is it likely.</p>

      his party to the Saut Ste. Marie, where "les J&eacute;suites les cong&eacute;di&egrave;rent." It
      then proceeds as follows: "Cependant M{r.} de la Salle continua son
      chemin par une rivi&egrave;re qui va de l'est &agrave; l'ouest; et
      passe &agrave; Onontaqu&eacute; [<i>Onondaga</i>], puis &agrave; six

      Huron, doubled the peninsula of Michigan, and passed La Baye des Puants
      (<i>Green Bay</i>)&mdash;says: "Il reconnut une baye incomparablement
      plus large; au fond de laquelle vers l'ouest il trouva un tr&egrave;s-beau
      havre et au fond de ce havre un fleuve qui va de l'est &agrave; l'ouest.

   <p>The "tr&egrave;s-beau havre" may have been the entrance of the river
      Chicago, whence, by an easy portage, he might have reached the Des
      Plaines branch of the Illinois. We shall see that he took this course
      in his famous exploration of 1682.</p>
   <p>The intendant Talon announces, in his despatches of this year that
      he had sent La Salle southward and westward to explore.</p>
   <p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_21" id="footnote_21"></a><a href="#fnanchor_21"> <span class="label">[21]</span></a> The following are his words (he speaks of himself in the third

   <p>This "autre rivi&egrave;re," which, it seems, was above the fall, may
      have been the Miami or the Scioto. There is but one fall on the river,
      that of Louisville, which is not so high as to deserve to be described
      as "fort haut," being only a strong rapid. The latitude, as will be
      seen, is different in the two accounts, and incorrect in both.</p>
   <p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_22" id="footnote_22"></a><a href="#fnanchor_22"> <span class="label">[22]</span></a> One of these maps is entitled <i>Carte de la d&eacute;couverte
         du Sieur Joliet</i>, 1674. Over the lines representing the Ohio
         are the words, "Route du sieur de la Salle pour aller dans le Mexique." The
         other map of Joliet bears, also written over the Ohio, the words, "Rivi&egrave;re
         par o&ugrave; descendit le sieur de la Salle au sortir du lac Eri&eacute; pour
         aller dans le Mexique." I have also another manuscript map, made
         before the voyage of Joliet and Marquette, and apparently in the
         year 1673, on which the Ohio is represented as far as to a point
         a little below Louisville, and over it is written, "Rivi&egrave;re
         Ohio, ainsy appell&eacute;e par les Iroquois &agrave; cause de sa
         beaut&eacute;, par o&ugrave; le sieur de la Salle est descendu." The
         Mississippi is not represented on this map; but&mdash;and this is
         very significant, as indicating the extent of La Salle's exploration
         of the following year&mdash;a small part of the upper Illinois is
         laid down.</p>

      speaks of "la grande rivi&egrave;re qu'il [<i>Joliet</i>] a trouv&eacute;e,
      qui va du nord au sud, et qui est aussi large que celle du Saint-Laurent
      vis-&agrave;-vis de Qu&eacute;bec." Four years later, Frontenac speaks
      slightingly of Joliet, but neither denies his discovery of the Mississippi,
      nor claims it for La Salle, in whose interest he writes.</p>
   <p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_24" id="footnote_24"></a><a href="#fnanchor_24"> <span class="label">[24]</span></a> <i>Papiers de Famille; M&eacute;moire pr&eacute;sent&eacute; au
         Roi.</i> The following is an extract: "Il parvient ... jusqu'&agrave; la
         rivi&egrave;re des Illinois. Il y construisit un fort situ&eacute; &agrave; 350
         lieues au-del&agrave; du fort de Frontenac, et suivant ensuite le

         eau</i>, environ cent lieues au-dessous du fort qu'il venoit de
         construire." This fort was Fort Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur, built in 1680,
         near the site of Peoria. The memoir goes on to relate the descent
         of La Salle to the Gulf, which concluded this expedition of 1679-82.</p>
   <p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_25" id="footnote_25"></a><a href="#fnanchor_25"> <span class="label">[25]</span></a> The following is an extract, given by Margry, from a letter of
      the aged Madeleine Cavelier, dated 21 F&eacute;vrier, 1756, and addressed
      to her nephew, M. Le Baillif, who had applied for the papers in behalf
      of the minister, Silhouette: "J'ay cherch&eacute; une occasion s&ucirc;re
      pour vous anvoy&eacute; les papiers de M. de la Salle. Il y a des cartes
      que j'ay jointe &agrave; ces papiers, qui doivent prouver que, en 1675,
      M. de Lasalle avet d&eacute;ja fet deux voyages en ces decouverte,
      puisqu'il y avet une carte, que je vous envoye, par laquelle il est
      fait mention de l'androit auquel M. de Lasalle aborda pr&egrave;s le
      fleuve de Mississipi; un autre androit qu'il nomme le fleuve Colbert;
      en un autre il prans possession de ce pais au nom du roy et fait planter
      une crois."</p>
   <p>The words of the aged and illiterate writer are obscure, but her expression "aborda
      pr&egrave;s" seems to indicate that La Salle had not reached the Mississippi
      prior to 1675, but only approached it. Finally, a memorial presented
      to Seignelay, along with the official narrative of 1679-81, by a friend
      of La Salle, whose object was to place the discoverer and his achievements
      in the most favorable light, contains the following: "Il [<i>La Salle</i>]
      a est&eacute; le premier &agrave; former le dessein de ces descouvertes,
      qu'il communiqua, il y a plus de quinze ans, &agrave; M. de Courcelles,
      gouverneur, et &agrave; M. Talon, intendant du Canada, qui l'approuv&egrave;rent.
      Il a fait ensuite plusieurs voyages de ce cost&eacute;-l&agrave;, et
      un entr'autres en 1669 avec MM. Dolier et Galin&eacute;e, prestres
      du S&eacute;minaire de St. Sulpice. <i>Il est vray que le sieur Jolliet,
      pour le pr&eacute;venir, fit un voyage in 1673, &agrave; la rivi&egrave;re
      Colbert</i>; mais ce fut uniquement pour y faire commerce." See Margry,
      ii. 285. This passage is a virtual admission that Joliet reached the
      Mississippi (<i>Colbert</i>) before La Salle.</p>
    <p>Margry, in a series of papers in the <i>Journal G&eacute;n&eacute;ral
         de l'Instruction Publique</i> for 1862, first took the position
         that La Salle reached the Mississippi in 1670 and 1671, and has
         brought forward in defence of it all the documents which his unwearied
         research enabled him to discover. Father Tailhan, S.J., has replied
         at length, in the copious notes to his edition of Nicolas Perrot,
         but without having seen the principal document cited by Margry,
         and of which extracts have been given in the notes to this chapter.</p>

<p class="center">THE JESUITS ON THE LAKES.</p>
<div class="smcap" style="padding-left:1.5em; text-indent:-1.5em">The Old Missions and
the New.&mdash;A Change of Spirit.&mdash;Lake Superior
and the Copper-mines.&mdash;Ste. Marie.&mdash;La
Pointe.&mdash;Michilimackinac.&mdash; Jesuits on Lake Michigan.&mdash;Allouez and
Dablon.&mdash;The Jesuit Fur-trade.</div>
<p><span class="smcap">What</span> were the Jesuits doing? Since the ruin of their great mission of
   the Hurons, a perceptible change had taken place in them. They had put
   forth exertions almost superhuman, set at naught famine, disease, and
   death, lived with the self-abnegation of saints and died with the devotion
   of martyrs; and the result of all had been a disastrous failure. From
   no short-coming on their part, but from the force of events beyond the
   sphere of their influence, a very demon of havoc had crushed their incipient
   churches, slaughtered their converts, uprooted the populous communities
   on which their hopes had rested, and scattered them in bands of wretched
   fugitives far and wide through the wilderness.<a name="fnanchor_26" id="fnanchor_26"></a><a href="#footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> They had devoted themselves
   in the fulness of faith to the building up <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg
   37]</a></span> of a Christian and Jesuit empire on the conversion of the
   great stationary tribes of the lakes; and of these none remained but the
   Iroquois, the destroyers of the rest,&mdash;among whom, indeed, was a
   field which might stimulate their zeal by an abundant promise of sufferings
   and martyrdoms, but which, from its geographical position, was too much
   exposed to Dutch and English influence to promise great and decisive results.
   Their best hopes were now in the North and the West; and thither, in great
   part, they had turned their energies.</p>
<div class="sidenote">REPORTS OF THE JESUITS.</div>
<p>We find them on Lake Huron, Lake Superior, and Lake Michigan, laboring
   vigorously as of old, but in a spirit not quite the same. Now, as before,
   two objects inspired their zeal,&mdash;the "greater glory of God," and
   the influence and credit of the Order of Jesus. If the one motive had
   somewhat lost in power, the other had gained. The epoch of the saints
   and martyrs was passing away; and henceforth we find the Canadian Jesuit
   less and less an apostle, more and more an explorer, a man of science,
   and a politician. The yearly reports of the missions are still, for the
   edification of the pious reader, filled with intolerably tedious stories
   of baptisms, conversions, and the exemplary deportment of neophytes,&mdash;for
   these have become a part of the formula; but they are relieved abundantly
   by more mundane topics. One finds observations on the winds, currents,
   and tides of the Great Lakes; speculations on a subterranean outlet of
   Lake Superior; accounts of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg
   38]</a></span> its copper-mines, and how we, the Jesuit fathers, are laboring
   to explore them for the profit of the colony; surmises touching the North
   Sea, the South Sea, the Sea of China, which we hope ere long to discover;
   and reports of that great mysterious river of which the Indians tell us,&mdash;flowing
   southward, perhaps to the Gulf of Mexico, perhaps to the Vermilion Sea,&mdash;and
   the secrets whereof, with the help of the Virgin, we will soon reveal
   to the world.</p>
<p>The Jesuit was as often a fanatic for his Order as for his faith; and
   oftener yet the two fanaticisms mingled in him inextricably. Ardently
   as he burned for the saving of souls, he would have none saved on the
   Upper Lakes except by his brethren and himself. He claimed a monopoly
   of conversion, with its attendant monopoly of toil, hardship, and martyrdom.
   Often disinterested for himself, he was inordinately ambitious for the
   great corporate power in which he had merged his own personality; and
   here lies one cause, among many, of the seeming contradictions which abound
   in the annals of the Order.</p>
<p>Prefixed to the <i>Relation</i> of 1671 is that monument of Jesuit hardihood
   and enterprise, the map of Lake Superior,&mdash;a work of which, however,
   the exactness has been exaggerated, as compared with other Canadian maps
   of the day. While making surveys, the priests were diligently looking
   for copper. Father Dablon reports that they had found it in greatest abundance
   on Isle Minong, now Isle Royale. "A day's journey from the head of the
   lake, on the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> south
   side, there is," he says, "a rock of copper weighing from six hundred
   to eight hundred pounds, lying on the shore where any who pass may see
   it;" and he further speaks of great copper boulders in the bed of the
   river Ontonagan.<a name="fnanchor_27" id="fnanchor_27"></a><a href="#footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">STE. MARIE DU SAUT.</div>
<p>There were two principal missions on the Upper Lakes, which were, in a
   certain sense, the parents of the rest. One of these was Ste. Marie du
   Saut,&mdash;the same visited by Dollier and Galin&eacute;e,&mdash;at the
   outlet of Lake Superior. This was a noted fishing-place; for the rapids
   were full of white-fish, and Indians came thither in crowds. The permanent
   residents were an Ojibwa band, whom the French called Sauteurs, and whose
   bark lodges were clustered <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg
   40]</a></span> at the foot of the rapids, near the fort of the Jesuits.
   Besides these, a host of Algonquins, of various tribes, resorted thither
   in the spring and summer,&mdash;living in abundance on the fishery, and
   dispersing in winter to wander and starve in scattered hunting-parties
   far and wide through the forests.</p>
<p>The other chief mission was that of St. Esprit, at La Pointe, near the
   western extremity of Lake Superior. Here were the Hurons, fugitives twenty
   years before from the slaughter of their countrymen; and the Ottawas,
   who, like them, had sought an asylum from the rage of the Iroquois. Many
   other tribes&mdash;Illinois, Pottawattamies, Foxes, Menomonies, Sioux,
   Assiniboins, Knisteneaux, and a multitude besides&mdash;came hither yearly
   to trade with the French. Here was a young Jesuit, Jacques Marquette,
   lately arrived from the Saut Ste. Marie. His savage flock disheartened
   him by its backslidings; and the best that he could report of the Hurons,
   after all the toil and all the blood lavished in their conversion, was,
   that they "still retain a little Christianity;" while the Ottawas are "far
   removed from the kingdom of God, and addicted beyond all other tribes
   to foulness, incantations, and sacrifices to evil spirits."<a name="fnanchor_28" id="fnanchor_28"></a><a href="#footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">MARQUETTE AND ANDR&Eacute;.</div>
<p>Marquette heard from the Illinois&mdash;yearly visitors at La Pointe&mdash;of
   the great river which they had crossed on their way,<a name="fnanchor_29" id="fnanchor_29"></a><a href="#footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and which, as
   he conjectured, flowed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg
   41]</a></span> into the Gulf of California. He heard marvels of it also
   from the Sioux, who lived on its banks; and a strong desire possessed
   him to explore the mystery of its course. A sudden calamity dashed his
   hopes. The Sioux&mdash;the Iroquois of the West, as the Jesuits call them&mdash;had
   hitherto kept the peace with the expatriated tribes of La Pointe; but
   now, from some cause not worth inquiry, they broke into open war, and
   so terrified the Hurons and Ottawas that they abandoned their settlements
   and fled. Marquette followed his panic-stricken flock, who, passing the
   Saut Ste. Marie, and descending to Lake Huron, stopped at length,&mdash;the
   Hurons at Michilimackinac, and the Ottawas at the Great Manitoulin Island.
   Two missions were now necessary to minister to the divided bands. That
   of Michilimackinac was assigned to Marquette, and that of the Manitoulin
   Island to Louis Andr&eacute;. The former took post at Point St. Ignace,
   on the north shore of the Straits of Michilimackinac, while the latter
   began the mission of St. Simon at the new abode of the Ottawas. When winter
   came, scattering his flock to their hunting-grounds, Andr&eacute; made
   a missionary tour among the Nipissings and other neighboring tribes. The
   shores of Lake Huron had long been an utter <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg
   42]</a></span> solitude, swept of their denizens by the terror of the
   all-conquering Iroquois; but now that these tigers had felt the power
   of the French, and learned for a time to leave their Indian allies in
   peace, the fugitive hordes were returning to their ancient abodes. Andr&eacute;'s
   experience among them was of the roughest. The staple of his diet was
   acorns and <i>tripe de roche</i>,&mdash;a species of lichen, which, being
   boiled, resolved itself into a black glue, nauseous, but not void of nourishment.
   At times, he was reduced to moss, the bark of trees, or moccasins and
   old moose-skins cut into strips and boiled. His hosts treated him very
   ill, and the worst of their fare was always his portion. When spring came
   to his relief, he returned to his post of St. Simon, with impaired digestion
   and unabated zeal.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE GREEN BAY MISSION.</div>
<p>Besides the Saut Ste. Marie and Michilimackinac, both noted fishing-places,
   there was another spot, no less famous for game and fish, and therefore
   a favorite resort of Indians. This was the head of the Green Bay of Lake
   Michigan.<a name="fnanchor_30" id="fnanchor_30"></a><a href="#footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Here and in adjacent districts several distinct tribes had
   made their abode. The Menomonies were on the river which bears their name;
   the Pottawattamies and Winnebagoes were <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg
   43]</a></span> near the borders of the bay; the Sacs, on Fox River; the
   Mascoutins, Miamis, and Kickapoos, on the same river, above Lake Winnebago;
   and the Outagamies, or Foxes, on a tributary of it flowing from the north.
   Green Bay was manifestly suited for a mission; and, as early as the autumn
   of 1669, Father Claude Allouez was sent thither to found one. After nearly
   perishing by the way, he set out to explore the destined field of his
   labors, and went as far as the town of the Mascoutins. Early in the autumn
   of 1670, having been joined by Dablon, Superior of the missions on the
   Upper Lakes, he made another journey, but not until the two fathers had
   held a council with the congregated tribes at St. Fran&ccedil;ois Xavier;
   for so they named their mission of Green Bay. Here, as they harangued
   their naked audience, their gravity was put to the proof; for a band of
   warriors, anxious to do them honor, walked incessantly up and down, aping
   the movements of the soldiers on guard before the governor's tent at Montreal. "We
   could hardly keep from laughing," writes Dablon, "though, we were discoursing
   on very important subjects; namely, the mysteries of our religion, and
   the things necessary to escaping from eternal fire."<a name="fnanchor_31" id="fnanchor_31"></a><a href="#footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>
<p>The fathers were delighted with the country, which Dablon calls an earthly
   paradise; but he adds that the way to it is as hard as the path to heaven.
   He alludes especially to the rapids of Fox River, which gave the two travellers
   great trouble. Having <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg
   44]</a></span> safely passed them, they saw an Indian idol on the bank,
   similar to that which Dollier and Galin&eacute;e found at Detroit,&mdash;being
   merely a rock, bearing some resemblance to a man, and hideously painted.
   With the help of their attendants, they threw it into the river. Dablon
   expatiates on the buffalo, which he describes apparently on the report
   of others, as his description is not very accurate. Crossing Winnebago
   Lake, the two priests followed the river leading to the town of the Mascoutins
   and Miamis, which they reached on the fifteenth of September.<a name="fnanchor_32" id="fnanchor_32"></a><a href="#footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> These
   two tribes lived together within the compass of the same enclosure of
   palisades,&mdash;to the number, it is said, of more than three thousand
   souls. The missionaries, who had brought a highly colored picture of the
   Last Judgment, called the Indians to council and displayed it before them;
   while Allouez, who spoke Algonquin, harangued them on hell, demons, and
   eternal flames. They listened with open ears, beset him night and day
   with questions, and invited him and his companion to unceasing feasts.
   They were welcomed in every lodge, and followed everywhere with eyes of
   curiosity, wonder, and awe. Dablon overflows with praises of the Miami
   chief, who was honored by his subjects like a king, and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg
   45]</a></span> whose demeanor towards his guests had no savor of the savage.</p>
<p>Their hosts told them of the great river Mississippi, rising far in the
   north and flowing southward,&mdash;they knew not whither,&mdash;and of
   many tribes that dwelt along its banks. When at length they took their
   departure, they left behind them a reputation as medicine-men of transcendent
   power.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE CROSS AMONG THE FOXES.</div>
<p>In the winter following, Allouez visited the Foxes, whom he found in extreme
   ill-humor. They were incensed against the French by the ill-usage which
   some of their tribe had lately met when on a trading visit to Montreal;
   and they received the Faith with shouts of derision. The priest was horror-stricken
   at what he saw. Their lodges, each containing from five to ten families,
   seemed in his eyes like seraglios; for some of the chiefs had eight wives.
   He armed himself with patience, and at length gained a hearing. Nay, he
   succeeded so well, that when he showed them his crucifix they would throw
   tobacco on it as an offering; and, on another visit which he made them
   soon after, he taught the whole village to make the sign of the cross.
   A war-party was going out against their enemies, and he bethought him
   of telling them the story of the Cross and the Emperor Constantine. This
   so wrought upon them that they all daubed the figure of a cross on their
   shields of bull-hide, set out for the war, and came back victorious, extolling
   the sacred symbol as a great war-medicine. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg
   46]</a></span></p>
<p>"Thus it is," writes Dablon, who chronicles the incident, "that our holy
   faith is established among these people; and we have good hope that we
   shall soon carry it to the famous river called the Mississippi, and perhaps
   even to the South Sea."<a name="fnanchor_33" id="fnanchor_33"></a><a href="#footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Most things human have their phases of the
   ludicrous; and the heroism of these untiring priests is no exception to
   the rule.</p>
<div class="sidenote">TRADING WITH INDIANS.</div>
<p>The various missionary stations were much alike. They consisted of a chapel
   (commonly of logs) and one or more houses, with perhaps a store-house
   and a workshop; the whole fenced with palisades, and forming, in fact,
   a stockade fort, surrounded with clearings and cultivated fields. It is
   evident that the priests had need of other hands than their own and those
   of the few lay brothers attached to the mission. They required men inured
   to labor, accustomed to the forest life, able to guide canoes and handle
   tools and weapons. In the earlier epoch of the missions, when enthusiasm
   was at its height, they were served in great measure by volunteers, who
   joined them through devotion or penitence, and who were known as <i>donn&eacute;s</i> or "given
   men." Of late, the number of these had much diminished; and they now relied
   chiefly on hired men, or <i>engag&eacute;s</i>. These were employed in
   building, hunting, fishing, clearing, and tilling the ground, guiding
   canoes, and (if faith is to be placed in reports current throughout the
   colony) in trading with the Indians for the profit <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg
   47]</a></span> of the missions. This charge of trading&mdash;which, if
   the results were applied exclusively to the support of the missions, does
   not of necessity involve much censure&mdash;is vehemently reiterated in
   many quarters, including the official despatches of the governor of Canada;
   while, so far as I can discover, the Jesuits never distinctly denied it,
   and on several occasions they partially admitted its truth.<a name="fnanchor_34" id="fnanchor_34"></a><a href="#footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>
<div class="footnotes">

      on the subject, so that the Jesuits had not as yet discovered the metal <i>in
      situ</i>, though they hoped soon to do so. The Indians told him that
      the copper had first been found by four hunters, who had landed on
      a certain island, near the north shore of the lake. Wishing to boil
      their food in a vessel of bark, they gathered stones on the shore,
      heated them red hot, and threw them in, but presently discovered them
      to be pure copper. Their repast over, they hastened to re-embark, being
      afraid of the lynxes and the hares, which, on this island, were as
      large as dogs, and which would have devoured their provisions, and
      perhaps their canoe. They took with them some of the wonderful stones;
      but scarcely had they left the island, when a deep voice, like thunder,
      sounded in their ears, "Who are these thieves who steal the toys of
      my children?" It was the God of the Waters, or some other powerful
      manito. The four adventurers retreated in great terror; but three of
      them soon died, and the fourth survived only long enough to reach his
      village, and tell the story. The island has no foundation, but floats
      with the movement of the wind; and no Indian dares land on its shores,
      dreading the wrath of the manito. Dablon, <i>Relation</i>, 1670, 84.</p>

      1671, 24, 25) says that they lived seven days' journey beyond the Mississippi,
      in eight villages. A few years later, most of them returned to the
      east side, and made their abode on the river Illinois.</p>

      portion of the bay was said to have an odor like the sea.</p>

<p class="center">FRANCE TAKES POSSESSION OF THE WEST.</p>
<div class="smcap" style="padding-left:1.5em; text-indent:-1.5em">Talon.&mdash;Saint-Lusson.&mdash;Perrot.&mdash;The Ceremony at Saut Ste. Marie.&mdash;The Speech of Allouez.&mdash;Count
Frontenac.</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean Talon</span>, intendant of Canada, was full of projects
   for the good of the colony. On the one hand, he set himself to the development
   of its industries, and, on the other, to the extension of its domain.
   He meant to occupy the interior of the continent, control the rivers,
   which were its only highways, and hold it for France against every other
   nation. On the east, England was to be hemmed within a narrow strip of
   seaboard; while, on the south, Talon aimed at securing a port on the Gulf
   of Mexico, to keep the Spaniards in check, and dispute with them the possession
   of the vast regions which they claimed as their own. But the interior
   of the continent was still an unknown world. It behooved him to explore
   it; and to that end he availed himself of Jesuits, officers, fur-traders,
   and enterprising schemers like La Salle. His efforts at discovery seem
   to have been conducted with a singular economy <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg
   49]</a></span> of the King's purse. La Salle paid all the expenses of
   his first expedition made under Talon's auspices; and apparently of the
   second also, though the intendant announces it in his despatches as an
   expedition sent out by himself.<a name="fnanchor_35" id="fnanchor_35"></a><a href="#footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> When, in 1670, he ordered Daumont
   de Saint-Lusson to search for copper mines on Lake Superior, and at the
   same time to take formal possession of the whole interior for the King,
   it was arranged that he should pay the costs of the journey by trading
   with the Indians.<a name="fnanchor_36" id="fnanchor_36"></a><a href="#footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">SAINT-LUSSON AND PERROT.</div>
<p>Saint-Lusson set out with a small party of men, and Nicolas Perrot as
   his interpreter. Among Canadian <i>voyageurs</i>, few names are so conspicuous
   as that of Perrot; not because there were not others who matched him in
   achievement, but because he could write, and left behind him a tolerable
   account of what he had seen.<a name="fnanchor_37" id="fnanchor_37"></a><a href="#footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> He was at this time twenty-six years
   old, and had formerly been an <i>engag&eacute;</i> of the Jesuits. He
   was a man of enterprise, courage, and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg
   50]</a></span> address,&mdash;the last being especially shown in his dealings
   with Indians, over whom he had great influence. He spoke Algonquin fluently,
   and was favorably known to many tribes of that family.</p>
<p>Saint-Lusson wintered at the Manitoulin Islands; while Perrot, having
   first sent messages to the tribes of the north, inviting them to meet
   the deputy of the governor at the Saut Ste. Marie in the following spring,
   proceeded to Green Bay, to urge the same invitation upon the tribes of
   that quarter. They knew him well, and greeted him with clamors of welcome.
   The Miamis, it is said, received him with a sham battle, which was designed
   to do him honor, but by which nerves more susceptible would have been
   severely shaken.<a name="fnanchor_38" id="fnanchor_38"></a><a href="#footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> They entertained him also with a grand game of <i>la
   crosse</i>, the Indian ball-play. Perrot gives a marvellous account of
   the authority and state of the Miami chief, who, he says, was attended
   day and night by a guard of warriors,&mdash;an assertion which would be
   incredible, were it not sustained by the account of the same chief given
   by the Jesuit Dablon. Of the tribes of the Bay, the greater part promised
   to send delegates to the Saut; but the Pottawattamies dissuaded the Miami
   potentate from attempting so long a journey, lest the fatigue incident
   to it might injure his health; and he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg
   51]</a></span> therefore deputed them to represent him and his tribesmen
   at the great meeting. Their principal chiefs, with those of the Sacs,
   Winnebagoes, and Menomonies, embarked, and paddled for the place of rendezvous,
   where they and Perrot arrived on the fifth of May.<a name="fnanchor_39" id="fnanchor_39"></a><a href="#footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>
<p>Saint-Lusson was here with his men, fifteen in number, among whom was
   Louis Joliet;<a name="fnanchor_40" id="fnanchor_40"></a><a href="#footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and Indians were fast thronging in from their wintering
   grounds, attracted, as usual, by the fishery of the rapids or moved by
   the messages sent by Perrot,&mdash;Crees, Monsonis, Amikou&eacute;s, Nipissings,
   and many more. When fourteen tribes, or their representatives, had arrived,
   Saint-Lusson prepared to execute the commission with which he was charged.</p>
<div class="sidenote">CEREMONY AT THE SAUT.</div>
<p>At the foot of the rapids was the village of the Sauteurs, above the village
   was a hill, and hard by stood the fort of the Jesuits. On the morning
   of the fourteenth of June, Saint-Lusson led his followers to the top of
   the hill, all fully equipped and under arms. Here, too, in the vestments
   of their priestly office, were four Jesuits,&mdash;Claude Dablon, Superior
   of the Missions of the lakes, Gabriel Druilletes, Claude Allouez, and
   Louis Andr&eacute;.<a name="fnanchor_41" id="fnanchor_41"></a><a href="#footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> All around the great throng of Indians stood,
   or crouched, or reclined at length, with eyes and ears intent. A <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg
   52]</a></span> large cross of wood had been made ready. Dablon, in solemn
   form, pronounced his blessing on it; and then it was reared and planted
   in the ground, while the Frenchmen, uncovered, sang the <i>Vexilla Regis</i>.
   Then a post of cedar was planted beside it, with a metal plate attached,
   engraven with the royal arms; while Saint-Lusson's followers sang the <i>Exaudiat</i>,
   and one of the Jesuits uttered a prayer for the King. Saint-Lusson now
   advanced, and, holding his sword in one hand, and raising with the other
   a sod of earth, proclaimed in a loud voice,&mdash;</p>
<p>"In the name of the Most High, Mighty, and Redoubted Monarch, Louis, Fourteenth
   of that name, Most Christian King of France and of Navarre, I take possession
   of this place, Sainte Marie du Saut, as also of Lakes Huron and Superior,
   the Island of Manitoulin, and all countries, rivers, lakes, and streams
   contiguous and adjacent thereunto,&mdash;both those which have been discovered
   and those which may be discovered hereafter, in all their length and breadth,
   bounded on the one side by the seas of the North and of the West, and
   on the other by the South Sea: declaring to the nations thereof that from
   this time forth they are vassals of his Majesty, bound to obey his laws
   and follow his customs; promising them on his part all succor and protection
   against the incursions and invasions of their enemies: declaring to all
   other potentates, princes, sovereigns, states, and republics,&mdash;to
   them and to their subjects,&mdash;that they cannot and are not to seize
   or settle upon any <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg
   53]</a></span> parts of the aforesaid countries, save only under the good
   pleasure of His Most Christian Majesty, and of him who will govern in
   his behalf; and this on pain of incurring his resentment and the efforts
   of his arms. <i>Vive le Roi</i>."<a name="fnanchor_42" id="fnanchor_42"></a><a href="#footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>
<p>The Frenchmen fired their guns and shouted "Vive le Roi," and the yelps
   of the astonished Indians mingled with the din.</p>
<p>What now remains of the sovereignty thus pompously proclaimed? Now and
   then the accents of France on the lips of some straggling boatman or vagabond
   half-breed,&mdash;this, and nothing more.</p>
<div class="sidenote">ALLOUEZ'S HARANGUE.</div>
<p>When the uproar was over, Father Allouez addressed the Indians in a solemn
   harangue; and these were his words: "It is a good work, my brothers, an
   important work, a great work, that brings us together in council to-day.
   Look up at the cross which rises so high above your heads. It was there
   that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, after making himself a man for the
   love of men, was nailed and died, to satisfy his Eternal Father for our
   sins. He is the master of our lives; the ruler of Heaven, Earth, and Hell.
   It is he of whom I am continually speaking to you, and whose name and
   word I have borne through all your country. But look at this post to which
   are fixed the arms of the great chief of France, whom we call King. He
   lives across the sea. He is the chief of the greatest chiefs, and has
   no equal on earth. All the chiefs whom you have ever seen are but children <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg
   54]</a></span> beside him. He is like a great tree, and they are but the
   little herbs that one walks over and tramples under foot. You know Onontio,<a name="fnanchor_43" id="fnanchor_43"></a><a href="#footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
   that famous chief at Quebec; you know and you have seen that he is the
   terror of the Iroquois, and that his very name makes them tremble, since
   he has laid their country waste and burned their towns with fire. Across
   the sea there are ten thousand Onontios like him, who are but the warriors
   of our great King, of whom I have told you. When he says, 'I am going
   to war,' everybody obeys his orders; and each of these ten thousand chiefs
   raises a troop of a hundred warriors, some on sea and some on land. Some
   embark in great ships, such as you have seen at Quebec. Your canoes carry
   only four or five men, or, at the most, ten or twelve; but our ships carry
   four or five hundred, and sometimes a thousand. Others go to war by land,
   and in such numbers that if they stood in a double file they would reach
   from here to Mississaquenk, which is more than twenty leagues off. When
   our King attacks his enemies, he is more terrible than the thunder: the
   earth trembles; the air and the sea are all on fire with the blaze of
   his cannon: he is seen in the midst of his warriors, covered over with
   the blood of his enemies, whom he kills in such numbers that he does not
   reckon them by the scalps, but by the streams of blood which he causes
   to flow. He takes so many prisoners that he holds them in no account,
   but lets them go where they will, to show <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg
   55]</a></span> that he is not afraid of them. But now nobody dares make
   war on him. All the nations beyond the sea have submitted to him and begged
   humbly for peace. Men come from every quarter of the earth to listen to
   him and admire him. All that is done in the world is decided by him alone.</p>
<p>"But what shall I say of his riches? You think yourselves rich when you
   have ten or twelve sacks of corn, a few hatchets, beads, kettles, and
   other things of that sort. He has cities of his own, more than there are
   of men in all this country for five hundred leagues around. In each city
   there are store-houses where there are hatchets enough to cut down all
   your forests, kettles enough to cook all your moose, and beads enough
   to fill all your lodges. His house is longer than from here to the top
   of the Saut,&mdash;that is to say, more than half a league,&mdash;and
   higher than your tallest trees; and it holds more families than the largest
   of your towns."<a name="fnanchor_44" id="fnanchor_44"></a><a href="#footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The father added more in a similar strain; but the
   peroration of his harangue is not on record.</p>
<p>Whatever impression this curious effort of Jesuit rhetoric may have produced
   upon the hearers, it did not prevent them from stripping the royal arms
   from the post to which they were nailed, as soon as Saint-Lusson and his
   men had left the Saut; probably, not because they understood the import
   of the symbol, but because they feared it as a charm. Saint-Lusson <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg
   56]</a></span> proceeded to Lake Superior, where, however, he accomplished
   nothing, except, perhaps, a traffic with the Indians on his own account;
   and he soon after returned to Quebec. Talon was resolved to find the Mississippi,
   the most interesting object of search, and seemingly the most attainable,
   in the wild and vague domain which he had just claimed for the King. The
   Indians had described it; the Jesuits were eager to discover it; and La
   Salle, if he had not reached it, had explored two several avenues by which
   it might be approached. Talon looked about him for a fit agent of the
   enterprise, and made choice of Louis Joliet, who had returned from Lake
   Superior.<a name="fnanchor_45" id="fnanchor_45"></a><a href="#footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> But the intendant was not to see the fulfilment of his design.
   His busy and useful career in Canada was drawing to an end. A misunderstanding
   had arisen between him and the governor, Courcelle. Both were faithful
   servants of the King; but the relations between the two chiefs of the
   colony were of a nature necessarily so critical, that a conflict of authority
   was scarcely to be avoided. Each thought his functions encroached upon,
   and both asked for recall. Another governor succeeded; one who was to
   stamp his mark, broad, bold, and ineffaceable, on the most memorable page
   of French-American History,&mdash;Louis de Buade, Count of Palluau and
   Frontenac.</p>

      of his second journey. On the sixth of August, 1671, he had received
      on credit, "dans son grand besoin et n&eacute;cessit&eacute;," from
      Branssac, fiscal attorney of the Seminary, merchandise to the amount
      of four hundred and fifty livres; and on the eighteenth of December

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> Talon had remained in the colony, Frontenac would infallibly have quarrelled
   with him; but he was too clear-sighted not to approve his plans for the
   discovery and occupation of the interior. Before sailing for France, Talon
   recommended Joliet as a suitable agent for the discovery of the Mississippi,
   and the governor accepted his counsel.<a name="fnanchor_46" id="fnanchor_46"></a><a href="#footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>
<p>Louis Joliet was the son of a wagon-maker in the service of the Company
   of the Hundred Associates,<a name="fnanchor_47" id="fnanchor_47"></a><a href="#footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> then owners of Canada. He was born at Quebec
   in 1645, and was educated by the Jesuits. When still very young, he resolved
   to be a priest. He received the tonsure and the minor orders at the age
   of seventeen. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg
   58]</a></span> Four years after, he is mentioned with especial honor for
   the part he bore in the disputes in philosophy, at which the dignitaries
   of the colony were present, and in which the intendant himself took part.<a name="fnanchor_48" id="fnanchor_48"></a><a href="#footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
   Not long after, he renounced his clerical vocation, and turned fur-trader.
   Talon sent him, with one P&eacute;r&eacute;, to explore the copper-mines
   of Lake Superior; and it was on his return from this expedition that he
   met La Salle and the Sulpitians near the head of Lake Ontario.<a name="fnanchor_49" id="fnanchor_49"></a><a href="#footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>
<p>In what we know of Joliet, there is nothing that reveals any salient or
   distinctive trait of character, any especial breadth of view or boldness
   of design. He appears to have been simply a merchant, intelligent, well
   educated, courageous, hardy, and enterprising. Though he had renounced
   the priesthood, he retained his partiality for the Jesuits; and it is
   more than probable that their influence had aided not a little to determine
   Talon's choice. One of their <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg
   59]</a></span> number, Jacques Marquette, was chosen to accompany him.</p>
<div class="sidenote">MARQUETTE.</div>
<p>He passed up the lakes to Michilimackinac, and found his destined companion
   at Point St. Ignace, on the north side of the strait, where, in his palisaded
   mission-house and chapel, he had labored for two years past to instruct
   the Huron refugees from St. Esprit, and a band of Ottawas who had joined
   them. Marquette was born in 1637, of an old and honorable family at Laon,
   in the north of France, and was now thirty-five years of age. When about
   seventeen, he had joined the Jesuits, evidently from motives purely religious;
   and in 1666 he was sent to the missions of Canada. At first, he was destined
   to the station of Tadoussac; and to prepare himself for it, he studied
   the Montagnais language under Gabriel Druilletes. But his destination
   was changed, and he was sent to the Upper Lakes in 1668, where he had
   since remained. His talents as a linguist must have been great; for within
   a few years he learned to speak with ease six Indian languages. The traits
   of his character are unmistakable. He was of the brotherhood of the early
   Canadian missionaries, and the true counterpart of Garnier or Jogues.
   He was a devout votary of the Virgin Mary, who, imaged to his mind in
   shapes of the most transcendent loveliness with which the pencil of human
   genius has ever informed the canvas, was to him the object of an adoration
   not unmingled with a sentiment of chivalrous devotion. The longings of
   a sensitive heart, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg
   60]</a></span> divorced from earth, sought solace in the skies. A subtile
   element of romance was blended with the fervor of his worship, and hung
   like an illumined cloud over the harsh and hard realities of his daily
   lot. Kindled by the smile of his celestial mistress, his gentle and noble
   nature knew no fear. For her he burned to dare and to suffer, discover
   new lands and conquer new realms to her sway.</p>
<p>He begins the journal of his voyage thus: "The day of the Immaculate Conception
   of the Holy Virgin; whom I had continually invoked since I came to this
   country of the Ottawas to obtain from God the favor of being enabled to
   visit the nations on the river Mississippi,&mdash;this very day was precisely
   that on which M. Joliet arrived with orders from Count Frontenac, our
   governor, and from M. Talon, our intendant, to go with me on this discovery.
   I was all the more delighted at this good news, because I saw my plans
   about to be accomplished, and found myself in the happy necessity of exposing
   my life for the salvation of all these tribes,&mdash;and especially of
   the Illinois, who, when I was at Point St. Esprit, had begged me very
   earnestly to bring the word of God among them."</p>
<div class="sidenote">DEPARTURE.</div>
<p>The outfit of the travellers was very simple. They provided themselves
   with two birch canoes, and a supply of smoked meat and Indian corn; embarked
   with five men, and began their voyage on the seventeenth of May. They
   had obtained all possible information from the Indians, and had made,
   by means <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> of
   it, a species of map of their intended route. "Above all," writes Marquette, "I
   placed our voyage under the protection of the Holy Virgin Immaculate,
   promising that if she granted us the favor of discovering the great river,
   I would give it the name of the Conception."<a name="fnanchor_50" id="fnanchor_50"></a><a href="#footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Their course was westward;
   and, plying their paddles, they passed the Straits of Michilimackinac,
   and coasted the northern shores of Lake Michigan, landing at evening to
   build their camp-fire at the edge of the forest, and draw up their canoes
   on the strand. They soon reached the river Menomonie, and ascended it
   to the village of the Menomonies, or Wild-rice Indians.<a name="fnanchor_51" id="fnanchor_51"></a><a href="#footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> When they
   told them the object of their voyage, they were filled with astonishment,
   and used their best ingenuity to dissuade them. The banks of the Mississippi,
   they said, were inhabited by ferocious tribes, who put every stranger
   to death, tomahawking all new-comers without cause or provocation. They
   added that there was a demon in a certain part of the river, whose roar
   could be heard at a great distance, and who would engulf them in the abyss
   where he dwelt; that its waters were full of frightful monsters, who would
   devour them and their canoe; and, finally, that the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg
   62]</a></span> heat was so great that they would perish inevitably. Marquette
   set their counsel at naught, gave them a few words of instruction in the
   mysteries of the Faith, taught them a prayer, and bade them farewell.</p>
<p>The travellers next reached the mission at the head of Green Bay; entered
   Fox River; with difficulty and labor dragged their canoes up the long
   and tumultuous rapids; crossed Lake Winnebago; and followed the quiet
   windings of the river beyond, where they glided through an endless growth
   of wild rice, and scared the innumerable birds that fed upon it. On either
   hand rolled the prairie, dotted with groves and trees, browsing elk and
   deer.<a name="fnanchor_52" id="fnanchor_52"></a><a href="#footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> On the seventh of June, they reached the Mascoutins and Miamis,
   who, since the visit of Dablon and Allouez, had been joined by the Kickapoos.
   Marquette, who had an eye for natural beauty, was delighted with the situation
   of the town, which he describes as standing on the crown of a hill; while,
   all around, the prairie stretched beyond the sight, interspersed with
   groves and belts of tall forest. But he was still more delighted when
   he saw a cross planted in the midst of the place. The Indians had decorated
   it with a number of dressed deer-skins, red girdles, and bows and arrows,
   which they had hung upon it as an offering to the Great Manitou of the
   French; a sight by which Marquette says he was "extremely consoled."</p>
   <p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg
   63]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">THE WISCONSIN RIVER.</div>
<p>The travellers had no sooner reached the town than they called the chiefs
   and elders to a council. Joliet told them that the governor of Canada
   had sent him to discover new countries, and that God had sent his companion
   to teach the true faith to the inhabitants; and he prayed for guides to
   show them the way to the waters of the Wisconsin. The council readily
   consented; and on the tenth of June the Frenchmen embarked again, with
   two Indians to conduct them. All the town came down to the shore to see
   their departure. Here were the Miamis, with long locks of hair dangling
   over each ear, after a fashion which Marquette thought very becoming;
   and here, too, the Mascoutins and the Kickapoos, whom he describes as
   mere boors in comparison with their Miami townsmen. All stared alike at
   the seven adventurers, marvelling that men could be found to risk an enterprise
   so hazardous.</p>
<p>The river twisted among lakes and marshes choked with wild rice; and,
   but for their guides, they could scarcely have followed the perplexed
   and narrow channel. It brought them at last to the portage, where, after
   carrying their canoes a mile and a half over the prairie and through the
   marsh, they launched them on the Wisconsin, bade farewell to the waters
   that flowed to the St. Lawrence, and committed themselves to the current
   that was to bear them they knew not whither,&mdash;perhaps to the Gulf
   of Mexico, perhaps to the South Sea or the Gulf of California. They glided
   calmly down the tranquil stream, by <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg
   64]</a></span> islands choked with trees and matted with entangling grape-vines;
   by forests, groves, and prairies, the parks and pleasure-grounds of a
   prodigal Nature; by thickets and marshes and broad bare sand-bars; under
   the shadowing trees, between whose tops looked down from afar the bold
   brow of some woody bluff. At night, the bivouac,&mdash;the canoes inverted
   on the bank, the flickering fire, the meal of bison-flesh or venison,
   the evening pipes, and slumber beneath the stars; and when in the morning
   they embarked again, the mist hung on the river like a bridal veil, then
   melted before the sun, till the glassy water and the languid woods basked
   breathless in the sultry glare.<a name="fnanchor_53" id="fnanchor_53"></a><a href="#footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">THE MISSISSIPPI.</div>
<p>On the seventeenth of June they saw on their right the broad meadows,
   bounded in the distance by rugged hills, where now stand the town and
   fort of Prairie du Chien. Before them a wide and rapid current coursed
   athwart their way, by the foot of lofty heights wrapped thick in forests.
   They had found what they sought, and "with a joy," writes Marquette, "which
   I cannot express," they steered forth their canoes on the eddies of the
   Mississippi.</p>
<p>Turning southward, they paddled down the stream, through a solitude unrelieved
   by the faintest trace of man. A large fish, apparently one of the huge
   cat-fish of the Mississippi, blundered against Marquette's canoe, with
   a force which seems to have startled him; and once, as they drew in their
   net, they caught <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg
   65]</a></span> a "spade-fish," whose eccentric appearance greatly astonished
   them. At length the buffalo began to appear, grazing in herds on the great
   prairies which then bordered the river; and Marquette describes the fierce
   and stupid look of the old bulls, as they stared at the intruders through
   the tangled mane which nearly blinded them.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE ILLINOIS INDIANS.</div>
<p>They advanced with extreme caution, landed at night, and made a fire to
   cook their evening meal; then extinguished it, embarked again, paddled
   some way farther, and anchored in the stream, keeping a man on the watch
   till morning. They had journeyed more than a fortnight without meeting
   a human being, when, on the twenty-fifth, they discovered footprints of
   men in the mud of the western bank, and a well-trodden path that led to
   the adjacent prairie. Joliet and Marquette resolved to follow it; and
   leaving the canoes in charge of their men, they set out on their hazardous
   adventure. The day was fair, and they walked two leagues in silence, following
   the path through the forest and across the sunny prairie, till they discovered
   an Indian village on the banks of a river, and two others on a hill half
   a league distant.<a name="fnanchor_54" id="fnanchor_54"></a><a href="#footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Now, with beating hearts, they invoked the aid of
   Heaven, and, again advancing, came so near, without being seen, that they
   could <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> hear
   the voices of the Indians among the wigwams. Then they stood forth in
   full view, and shouted to attract attention. There was great commotion
   in the village. The inmates swarmed out of their huts, and four of their
   chief men presently came forward to meet the strangers, advancing very
   deliberately, and holding up toward the sun two calumets, or peace-pipes,
   decorated with feathers. They stopped abruptly before the two Frenchmen,
   and stood gazing at them without speaking a word. Marquette was much relieved
   on seeing that they wore French cloth, whence he judged that they must
   be friends and allies. He broke the silence, and asked them who they were;
   whereupon they answered that they were Illinois, and offered the pipe;
   which having been duly smoked, they all went together to the village.
   Here the chief received the travellers after a singular fashion, meant
   to do them honor. He stood stark naked at the door of a large wigwam,
   holding up both hands as if to shield his eyes. "Frenchmen, how bright
   the sun shines when you come to visit us! All our village awaits you;
   and you shall enter our wigwams in peace." So saying, he led them into
   his own, which was crowded to suffocation with savages, staring at their
   guests in silence. Having smoked with the chiefs and old men, they were
   invited to visit the great chief of all the Illinois, at one of the villages
   they had seen in the distance; and thither they proceeded, followed by
   a throng of warriors, squaws, and children. On <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg
   67]</a></span> arriving, they were forced to smoke again, and listen to
   a speech of welcome from the great chief, who delivered it standing between
   two old men, naked like himself. His lodge was crowded with the dignitaries
   of the tribe, whom Marquette addressed in Algonquin, announcing himself
   as a messenger sent by the God who had made them, and whom it behooves
   them to recognize and obey. He added a few words touching the power and
   glory of Count Frontenac, and concluded by asking information concerning
   the Mississippi, and the tribes along its banks, whom he was on his way
   to visit. The chief replied with a speech of compliment; assuring his
   guests that their presence added flavor to his tobacco, made the river
   more calm, the sky more serene, and the earth more beautiful. In conclusion,
   he gave them a young slave and a calumet, begging them at the same time
   to abandon their purpose of descending the Mississippi.</p>
<p>A feast of four courses now followed. First, a wooden bowl full of a porridge
   of Indian meal boiled with grease was set before the guests; and the master
   of ceremonies fed them in turn, like infants, with a large spoon. Then
   appeared a platter of fish; and the same functionary, carefully removing
   the bones with his fingers, and blowing on the morsels to cool them, placed
   them in the mouths of the two Frenchmen. A large dog, killed and cooked
   for the occasion, was next placed before them; but, failing to tempt their
   fastidious appetites, was supplanted by a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg
   68]</a></span> dish of fat buffalo-meat, which concluded the entertainment.
   The crowd having dispersed, buffalo-robes were spread on the ground, and
   Marquette and Joliet spent the night on the scene of the late festivity.
   In the morning, the chief, with some six hundred of his tribesmen, escorted
   them to their canoes, and bade them, after their stolid fashion, a friendly
   farewell.</p>
<div class="sidenote">A REAL DANGER.</div>
<p>Again they were on their way, slowly drifting down the great river. They
   passed the mouth of the Illinois, and glided beneath that line of rocks
   on the eastern side, cut into fantastic forms by the elements, and marked
   as "The Ruined Castles" on some of the early French maps. Presently they
   beheld a sight which reminded them that the Devil was still lord paramount
   of this wilderness. On the flat face of a high rock were painted, in red,
   black, and green, a pair of monsters, each "as large as a calf, with horns
   like a deer, red eyes, a beard like a tiger, and a frightful expression
   of countenance. The face is something like that of a man, the body covered
   with scales; and the tail so long that it passes entirely round the body,
   over the head and between the legs, ending like that of a fish." Such
   is the account which the worthy Jesuit gives of these manitous, or Indian
   gods.<a name="fnanchor_55" id="fnanchor_55"></a><a href="#footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> He confesses that at first they frightened <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg
   69]</a></span> him; and his imagination and that of his credulous companions
   was so wrought upon by these unhallowed efforts of Indian art, that they
   continued for a long time to talk of them as they plied their paddles.
   They were thus engaged, when they were suddenly aroused by a real danger.
   A torrent of yellow mud rushed furiously athwart the calm blue current
   of the Mississippi, boiling and surging, and sweeping in its course logs,
   branches, and uprooted trees. They had reached the mouth of the Missouri,
   where that savage river, descending from its mad career through a vast
   unknown of barbarism, poured its turbid floods into the bosom of its gentler
   sister. Their light canoes whirled on the miry vortex like dry leaves
   on an angry brook. "I never," writes Marquette, "saw anything more terrific;" but
   they escaped with their fright, and held their way down the turbulent
   and swollen current of the now united rivers.<a name="fnanchor_56" id="fnanchor_56"></a><a href="#footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> They passed the lonely
   forest that covered <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg
   70]</a></span> the site of the destined city of St. Louis, and, a few
   days later, saw on their left the mouth of the stream to which the Iroquois
   had given the well-merited name of Ohio, or the "Beautiful River."<a name="fnanchor_57" id="fnanchor_57"></a><a href="#footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
   Soon they began to see the marshy shores buried in a dense growth of the
   cane, with its tall straight stems and feathery light-green foliage. The
   sun glowed through the hazy air with a languid stifling heat, and by day
   and night mosquitoes in myriads left them no peace. They floated slowly
   down the current, crouched in the shade of the sails which they had spread
   as awnings, when suddenly they saw Indians on the east bank. The surprise
   was mutual, and each party was as much frightened as the other. Marquette
   hastened to display the calumet which the Illinois had given him by way
   of passport; and the Indians, recognizing the pacific symbol, replied
   with an invitation to land. Evidently, they were in communication with
   Europeans, for they were armed with guns, knives, and hatchets, wore garments
   of cloth, and carried their gunpowder in small bottles of thick glass.
   They feasted the Frenchmen with buffalo-meat, bear's oil, and white plums;
   and gave them a variety of doubtful information, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg
   71]</a></span> including the agreeable but delusive assurance that they
   would reach the mouth of the river in ten days. It was, in fact, more
   than a thousand miles distant.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI.</div>
<p>They resumed their course, and again floated down the interminable monotony
   of river, marsh, and forest. Day after day passed on in solitude, and
   they had paddled some three hundred miles since their meeting with the
   Indians, when, as they neared the mouth of the Arkansas, they saw a cluster
   of wigwams on the west bank. Their inmates were all astir, yelling the
   war-whoop, snatching their weapons, and running to the shore to meet the
   strangers, who, on their part, called for succor to the Virgin. In truth,
   they had need of her aid; for several large wooden canoes, filled with
   savages, were putting out from the shore, above and below them, to cut
   off their retreat, while a swarm of headlong young warriors waded into
   the water to attack them. The current proved too strong; and, failing
   to reach the canoes of the Frenchmen, one of them threw his war-club,
   which flew over the heads of the startled travellers. Meanwhile, Marquette
   had not ceased to hold up his calumet, to which the excited crowd gave
   no heed, but strung their bows and notched their arrows for immediate
   action; when at length the elders of the village arrived, saw the peace-pipe,
   restrained the ardor of the youth, and urged the Frenchmen to come ashore.
   Marquette and his companions complied, trembling, and found a better reception
   than <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> they
   had reason to expect. One of the Indians spoke a little Illinois, and
   served as interpreter; a friendly conference was followed by a feast of
   sagamite and fish; and the travellers, not without sore misgivings, spent
   the night in the lodges of their entertainers.<a name="fnanchor_58" id="fnanchor_58"></a><a href="#footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">THE ARKANSAS.</div>
<p>Early in the morning, they embarked again, and proceeded to a village
   of the Arkansas tribe, about eight leagues below. Notice of their coming
   was sent before them by their late hosts; and as they drew near they were
   met by a canoe, in the prow of which stood a naked personage, holding
   a calumet, singing, and making gestures of friendship. On reaching the
   village, which was on the east side,<a name="fnanchor_59" id="fnanchor_59"></a><a href="#footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> opposite the mouth of the river
   Arkansas, they were conducted to a sort of scaffold, before the lodge
   of the war-chief. The space beneath had been prepared for their reception,
   the ground being neatly covered with rush mats. On these they were seated;
   the warriors sat around them in a semi-circle; then the elders of the
   tribe; and then the promiscuous crowd of villagers, standing, and staring
   over the heads of the more dignified members of the assembly. All the
   men were naked; but, to compensate for the lack of clothing, they wore
   strings of beads in their noses and ears. The women were clothed in shabby
   skins, and wore their hair clumped in a mass behind each <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg
   73]</a></span> ear. By good luck, there was a young Indian in the village,
   who had an excellent knowledge of Illinois; and through him Marquette
   endeavored to explain the mysteries of Christianity, and to gain information
   concerning the river below. To this end he gave his auditors the presents
   indispensable on such occasions, but received very little in return. They
   told him that the Mississippi was infested by hostile Indians, armed with
   guns procured from white men; and that they, the Arkansas, stood in such
   fear of them that they dared not hunt the buffalo, but were forced to
   live on Indian corn, of which they raised three crops a year.</p>
<p>During the speeches on either side, food was brought in without ceasing,&mdash;sometimes
   a platter of sagamite or mush; sometimes of corn boiled whole; sometimes
   a roasted dog. The villagers had large earthen pots and platters, made
   by themselves with tolerable skill, as well as hatchets, knives, and beads,
   gained by traffic with the Illinois and other tribes in contact with the
   French or Spaniards. All day there was feasting without respite, after
   the merciless practice of Indian hospitality; but at night some of their
   entertainers proposed to kill and plunder them,&mdash;a scheme which was
   defeated by the vigilance of the chief, who visited their quarters, and
   danced the calumet dance to reassure his guests.</p>
<p>The travellers now held counsel as to what course they should take. They
   had gone far enough, as they thought, to establish one important point,&mdash;that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg
   74]</a></span> the Mississippi discharged its waters, not into the Atlantic
   or sea of Virginia, nor into the Gulf of California or Vermilion Sea,
   but into the Gulf of Mexico. They thought themselves nearer to its mouth
   than they actually were, the distance being still about seven hundred
   miles; and they feared that if they went farther they might be killed
   by Indians or captured by Spaniards, whereby the results of their discovery
   would be lost. Therefore they resolved to return to Canada, and report
   what they had seen.</p>
<p>They left the Arkansas village, and began their homeward voyage on the
   seventeenth of July. It was no easy task to urge their way upward, in
   the heat of midsummer, against the current of the dark and gloomy stream,
   toiling all day under the parching sun, and sleeping at night in the exhalations
   of the unwholesome shore, or in the narrow confines of their birchen vessels,
   anchored on the river. Marquette was attacked with dysentery. Languid
   and well-nigh spent, he invoked his celestial mistress, as day after day,
   and week after week, they won their slow way northward. At length, they
   reached the Illinois, and, entering its mouth, followed its course, charmed,
   as they went, with its placid waters, its shady forests, and its rich
   plains, grazed by the bison and the deer. They stopped at a spot soon
   to be made famous in the annals of western discovery. This was a village
   of the Illinois, then called "Kaskaskia;" a name afterwards transferred
   to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> another
   locality.<a name="fnanchor_60" id="fnanchor_60"></a><a href="#footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> A chief, with a band of young warriors, offered to guide
   them to the Lake of the Illinois; that is to say, Lake Michigan. Thither
   they repaired; and, coasting its shores, reached Green Bay at the end
   of September, after an absence of about four months, during which they
   had paddled their canoes somewhat more than two thousand five hundred
   miles.<a name="fnanchor_61" id="fnanchor_61"></a><a href="#footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">RETURN TO CANADA.</div>
<p>Marquette remained to recruit his exhausted strength; but Joliet descended
   to Quebec, to bear the report of his discovery to Count Frontenac. Fortune
   had wonderfully favored him on his long and perilous journey; but now
   she abandoned him on the very threshold of home. At the foot of the rapids
   of La Chine, and immediately above Montreal, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg
   76]</a></span> his canoe was overset, two of his men and an Indian boy
   were drowned, all his papers were lost, and he himself narrowly escaped.<a name="fnanchor_62" id="fnanchor_62"></a><a href="#footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
   In a letter to Frontenac, he speaks of the accident as follows: "I had
   escaped every peril from the Indians; I had passed forty-two rapids; and
   was on the point of disembarking, full of joy at the success of so long
   and difficult an enterprise, when my canoe capsized, after all the danger
   seemed over. I lost two men and my box of papers, within sight of the
   first French settlements, which I had left almost two years before. Nothing
   remains to me but my life, and the ardent desire to employ it on any service
   which you may please to direct."<a name="fnanchor_63" id="fnanchor_63"></a><a href="#footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>
   <p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg
   77]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">MARQUETTE'S MISSION.</div>
<p>Marquette spent the winter and the following summer at the mission of
   Green Bay, still suffering from his malady. In the autumn, however, it
   abated; and he was permitted by his Superior to attempt the execution
   of a plan to which he was devotedly attached,&mdash;the founding, at the
   principal town of the Illinois, of a mission to be called the "Immaculate
   Conception," a name which he had already given to the river Mississippi.
   He set out on this errand on the twenty-fifth of October, accompanied
   by two men, named Pierre and Jacques, one of whom had been with him on
   his great journey of discovery. A band of Pottawattamies and another band
   of Illinois also joined him. The united parties&mdash;ten canoes in all&mdash;followed
   the east shore of Green Bay as far as the inlet then called "Sturgeon
   Cove," from the head of which they crossed by a difficult portage through
   the forest to the shore of Lake Michigan. November had come. The bright
   hues of the autumn foliage were changed to rusty brown. The shore was
   desolate, and the lake was stormy. They were more <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg
   78]</a></span> than a month in coasting its western border, when at length
   they reached the river Chicago, entered it, and ascended about two leagues.
   Marquette's disease had lately returned, and hemorrhage now ensued. He
   told his two companions that this journey would be his last. In the condition
   in which he was, it was impossible to go farther. The two men built a
   log hut by the river, and here they prepared to spend the winter; while
   Marquette, feeble as he was, began the spiritual exercises of Saint Ignatius,
   and confessed his two companions twice a week.</p>
<p>Meadow, marsh, and forest were sheeted with snow, but game was abundant.
   Pierre and Jacques killed buffalo and deer, and shot wild turkeys close
   to their hut. There was an encampment of Illinois within two days' journey;
   and other Indians, passing by this well-known thoroughfare, occasionally
   visited them, treating the exiles kindly, and sometimes bringing them
   game and Indian corn. Eighteen leagues distant was the camp of two adventurous
   French traders,&mdash;one of them, a noted <i>coureur de bois</i>, nicknamed
   La Taupine;<a name="fnanchor_64" id="fnanchor_64"></a><a href="#footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and the other, a self-styled surgeon. They also visited
   Marquette, and befriended him to the best of their power.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE MISSION AT KASKASKIA.</div>
<p>Urged by a burning desire to lay, before he died, the foundation of his
   new mission of the Immaculate Conception, Marquette begged his two followers
   to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> join
   him in a <i>novena</i>, or nine days' devotion to the Virgin. In consequence
   of this, as he believed, his disease relented; he began to regain strength,
   and in March was able to resume the journey. On the thirtieth of the month,
   they left their hut, which had been inundated by a sudden rise of the
   river, and carried their canoe through mud and water over the portage
   which led to the Des Plaines. Marquette knew the way, for he had passed
   by this route on his return from the Mississippi. Amid the rains of opening
   spring, they floated down the swollen current of the Des Plaines, by naked
   woods and spongy, saturated prairies, till they reached its junction with
   the main stream of the Illinois, which they descended to their destination,
   the Indian town which Marquette calls "Kaskaskia." Here, as we are told,
   he was received "like an angel from Heaven." He passed from wigwam to
   wigwam, telling the listening crowds of God and the Virgin, Paradise and
   Hell, angels and demons; and, when he thought their minds prepared, he
   summoned them all to a grand council.</p>
<p>It took place near the town, on the great meadow which lies between the
   river and the modern village of Utica. Here five hundred chiefs and old
   men were seated in a ring; behind stood fifteen hundred youths and warriors,
   and behind these again all the women and children of the village. Marquette,
   standing in the midst, displayed four large pictures of the Virgin; harangued
   the assembly on the mysteries of the Faith, and exhorted them to adopt
   it. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> The
   temper of his auditory met his utmost wishes. They begged him to stay
   among them and continue his instructions; but his life was fast ebbing
   away, and it behooved him to depart.</p>
<div class="sidenote">BURIAL OF MARQUETTE.</div>
<p>A few days after Easter he left the village, escorted by a crowd of Indians,
   who followed him as far as Lake Michigan. Here he embarked with his two
   companions. Their destination was Michilimackinac, and their course lay
   along the eastern borders of the lake. As, in the freshness of advancing
   spring, Pierre and Jacques urged their canoe along that lonely and savage
   shore, the priest lay with dimmed sight and prostrated strength, communing
   with the Virgin and the angels. On the nineteenth of May, he felt that
   his hour was near; and, as they passed the mouth of a small river, he
   requested his companions to land. They complied, built a shed of bark
   on a rising ground near the bank, and carried thither the dying Jesuit.
   With perfect cheerfulness and composure, he gave directions for his burial,
   asked their forgiveness for the trouble he had caused them, administered
   to them the sacrament of penitence, and thanked God that he was permitted
   to die in the wilderness, a missionary of the Faith and a member of the
   Jesuit brotherhood. At night, seeing that they were fatigued, he told
   them to take rest, saying that he would call them when he felt his time
   approaching. Two or three hours after, they heard a feeble voice, and,
   hastening to his side, found him at the point of death. He expired calmly,
   murmuring <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> the
   names of Jesus and Mary, with his eyes fixed on the crucifix which one
   of his followers held before him. They dug a grave beside the hut, and
   here they buried him according to the directions which he had given them;
   then, re-embarking, they made their way to Michilimackinac, to bear the
   tidings to the priests at the mission of St. Ignace.<a name="fnanchor_65" id="fnanchor_65"></a><a href="#footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>
<p>In the winter of 1676, a party of Kiskakon Ottawas were hunting on Lake
   Michigan; and when, in the following spring, they prepared to return home,
   they bethought them, in accordance with an Indian custom, of taking with
   them the bones of Marquette, who had been their instructor at the mission
   of St. Esprit. They repaired to the spot, found the grave, opened it,
   washed and dried the bones and placed them carefully in a box of birch-bark.
   Then, in a procession of thirty canoes, they bore it, singing their funeral
   songs, to St. Ignace of Michilimackinac. As they approached, priests,
   Indians, and traders all thronged to the shore. The relics of Marquette
   were received with solemn ceremony, and buried beneath the floor of the
   little chapel of the mission.<a name="fnanchor_66" id="fnanchor_66"></a><a href="#footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

      the city of Alton. The tradition of their existence remains, though
      they are entirely effaced by time. In 1867, when I passed the place,
      a part of the rock had been quarried away, and, instead of Marquette's
      monsters, it bore a huge advertisement of "Plantation Bitters." Some
      years ago, certain persons, with more zeal than knowledge, proposed
      to restore the figures, after conceptions of their own; but the idea
      was abandoned.</p>
   <p>Marquette made a drawing of the two monsters, but it is lost. I have,
      however, a fac-simile of a map made a few years later, by order of
      the Intendant Duchesneau, which is decorated with the portrait of one
      of them, answering to Marquette's description, and probably copied
      from his drawing. St. Cosme, who saw them in 1699, says that they were
      even then almost effaced. Douay and Joutel also speak of them,&mdash;the
      former, bitterly hostile to his Jesuit contemporaries, charging Marquette
      with exaggeration in his account of them. Joutel could see nothing
      terrifying in their appearance; but he says that his Indians made sacrifices
      to them as they passed.</p>

      this name is placed near its banks, just above the Osages. Judging
      by the course of the Mississippi that it discharged into the Gulf of
      Mexico, he conceived the hope of one day reaching the South Sea by

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_61" id="footnote_61"></a><a href="#fnanchor_61"> <span class="label">[61]</span></a> The journal of Marquette, first published in an imperfect form
      by Thevenot, in 1681, has been reprinted by Mr. Lenox, under the direction
      of Mr. Shea, from the manuscript preserved in the archives of the Canadian
      Jesuits. It will also be found in Shea's <i>Discovery and Exploration
      of the Mississippi Valley</i>, and the <i>Relations In&eacute;dites</i> of
      Martin. The true map of Marquette accompanies all these publications.
      The map published by Thevenot and reproduced by Bancroft is not Marquette's.
      The original of this, of which I have a fac-simile, bears the title <i>Carte
      de la Nouvelle D&eacute;couverte que les P&egrave;res J&eacute;suites
      ont faite en l'ann&eacute;e 1672, et continu&eacute;e par le P&egrave;re
      Jacques Marquette, etc.</i> The return route of the expedition is incorrectly
      laid down on it. A manuscript map of the Jesuit Raffeix, preserved
      in the Biblioth&egrave;que Imp&eacute;riale, is more accurate in this
      particular. I have also another contemporary manuscript map, indicating
      the various Jesuit stations in the West at this time, and representing
      the Mississippi, as discovered by Marquette. For these and other maps,

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_63" id="footnote_63"></a><a href="#fnanchor_63"> <span class="label">[63]</span></a> This letter is appended to Joliet's smaller map of his discoveries.
      See Appendix. Compare <i>D&eacute;tails sur le Voyage de Louis Joliet</i> and <i>Relation
      de la Descouverte de plusieurs Pays situez au midi de la Nouvelle France,
      faite en 1673</i> (Margry, i. 259). These are oral accounts given by
      Joliet after the loss of his papers. Also, <i>Lettre de Joliet, Oct.
      10, 1674</i> (Harrisse). On the seventh of October, 1675, Joliet married
      Claire Bissot, daughter of a wealthy Canadian merchant, engaged in
      trade with the northern Indians. This drew Joliet's attention to Hudson's
      Bay; and he made a journey thither in 1679, by way of the Saguenay.
      He found three English forts on the bay, occupied by about sixty men,
      who had also an armed vessel of twelve guns and several small trading-craft.
      The English held out great inducements to Joliet to join them; but
      he declined, and returned to Quebec, where he reported that unless
      these formidable rivals were dispossessed, the trade of Canada would
      be ruined. In consequence of this report, some of the principal merchants
      of the colony formed a company to compete with the English in the trade
      of Hudson's Bay. In the year of this journey, Joliet received a grant
      of the islands of Mignan; and in the following year, 1652, he received
      another grant, of the great island of Anticosti in the lower St. Lawrence.
      In 1681 he was established here, with his wife and six servants. He
      was engaged in fisheries; and, being a skilful navigator and surveyor,
      he made about this time a chart of the St. Lawrence. In 1690, Sir William
      Phips, on his way with an English fleet to attack Quebec, made a descent
      on Joliet's establishment, burnt his buildings, and took prisoners
      his wife and his mother-in-law. In 1694 Joliet explored the coasts
      of Labrador, under the auspices of a company formed for the whale and
      seal fishery. On his return, Frontenac made him royal pilot for the
      St. Lawrence; and at about the same time he received the appointment
      of hydrographer at Quebec. He died, apparently poor, in 1699 or 1700,
      and was buried on one of the islands of Mignan. The discovery of the
      above facts is due in great part to the researches of Margry.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_64" id="footnote_64"></a><a href="#fnanchor_64"> <span class="label">[64]</span></a> Pierre Moreau, <i>alias</i> La Taupine, was afterwards bitterly
      complained of by the Intendant Duchesneau, for acting as the governor's
      agent in illicit trade with the Indians.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_65" id="footnote_65"></a><a href="#fnanchor_65"> <span class="label">[65]</span></a> The contemporary <i>Relation</i> tells us that a miracle took
      place at the burial of Marquette. One of the two Frenchmen, overcome
      with grief and colic, bethought him of applying a little earth from
      the grave to the seat of pain. This at once restored him to health
      and cheerfulness.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_66" id="footnote_66"></a><a href="#fnanchor_66"> <span class="label">[66]</span></a> For Marquette's death, see the contemporary <i>Relation</i>, published
      by Shea, Lenox, and Martin, with the accompanying <i>Lettre et Journal</i>.
      The river where he died is a small stream in the west of Michigan,
      some distance south of the promontory called the "Sleeping Bear." It
      long bore his name, which is now borne by a larger neighboring stream,
      Charlevoix's account of Marquette's death is derived from tradition,
      and is not supported by the contemporary narrative. In 1877, human
      bones, with fragments of birch-bark, were found buried on the supposed
      site of the Jesuit chapel at Point St. Ignace.</p>
   <p>In 1847, the missionary of the Algonquins at the Lake of Two Mountains,
      above Montreal, wrote down a tradition of the death of Marquette, from
      the lips of an old Indian woman, born in 1777, at Michilimackinac.
      Her ancestress had been baptized by the subject of the story. The tradition
      has a resemblance to that related as fact by Charlevoix. The old squaw
      said that the Jesuit was returning, very ill, to Michilimackinac, when
      a storm forced him and his two men to land near a little river. Here
      he told them that he should die, and directed them to ring a bell over
      his grave and plant a cross. They all remained four days at the spot;
      and, though without food, the men felt no hunger. On the night of the
      fourth day he died, and the men buried him as he had directed. On waking
      in the morning, they saw a sack of Indian corn, a quantity of bacon,
      and some biscuit, miraculously sent to them, in accordance with the
      promise of Marquette, who had told them that they should have food
      enough for their journey to Michilimackinac. At the same instant, the
      stream began to rise, and in a few moments encircled the grave of the
      Jesuit, which formed, thenceforth, an islet in the waters. The tradition
      adds, that an Indian battle afterwards took place on the banks of this
      stream, between Christians and infidels; and that the former gained
      the victory, in consequence of invoking the name of Marquette. This
      story bears the attestation of the priest of the Two Mountains that
      it is a literal translation of the tradition, as recounted by the old
      woman.</p>
   <p>It has been asserted that the Illinois country was visited by two priests,
      some time before the visit of Marquette. This assertion was first made
      by M. Noiseux, late Grand Vicar of Quebec, who gives no authority for
      it. Not the slightest indication of any such visit appears in any contemporary
      document or map, thus far discovered. The contemporary writers, down
      to the time of Marquette and La Salle, all speak of the Illinois as
      an unknown country. The entire groundlessness of Noiseux's assertion
      is shown by Shea, in a paper in the "Weekly Herald," of New York, April
      21, 1855.</p>

<p class="center">LA SALLE AND FRONTENAC.</p>
<div class="smcap" style="padding-left:1.5em; text-indent:-1.5em">Objects of La Salle.&mdash;Frontenac favors him.&mdash;Projects of Frontenac.&mdash;Cataraqui.&mdash;Frontenac
on Lake Ontario.&mdash;Fort Frontenac.&mdash;La Salle and F&eacute;nelon.&mdash;Success
of La Salle: his Enemies.</div>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> turn from the humble Marquette, thanking God with his last breath that
   he died for his Order and his Faith; and by our side stands the masculine
   form of Cavelier de la Salle. Prodigious was the contrast between the
   two discoverers: the one, with clasped hands and upturned eyes, seems
   a figure evoked from some dim legend of medi&aelig;val saintship; the
   other, with feet firm planted on the hard earth, breathes the self-relying
   energies of modern practical enterprise. Nevertheless, La Salle's enemies
   called him a visionary. His projects perplexed and startled them. At first,
   they ridiculed him; and then, as step by step he advanced towards his
   purpose, they denounced and maligned him. What was this purpose? It was
   not of sudden growth, but developed as years went on. La Salle at La Chine
   dreamed of a western passage to China, and nursed vague <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg
   84]</a></span> schemes of western discovery. Then, when his earlier journeyings
   revealed to him the valley of the Ohio and the fertile plains of Illinois,
   his imagination took wing over the boundless prairies and forests drained
   by the great river of the West. His ambition had found its field. He would
   leave barren and frozen Canada behind, and lead France and civilization
   into the valley of the Mississippi. Neither the English nor the Jesuits
   should conquer that rich domain: the one must rest content with the country
   east of the Alleghanies, and the other with the forests, savages, and
   beaver-skins of the northern lakes. It was for him to call into light
   the latent riches of the great West. But the way to his land of promise
   was rough and long: it lay through Canada, filled with hostile traders
   and hostile priests, and barred by ice for half the year. The difficulty
   was soon solved. La Salle became convinced that the Mississippi flowed,
   not into the Pacific or the Gulf of California, but into the Gulf of Mexico.
   By a fortified post at its mouth, he could guard it against both English
   and Spaniards, and secure for the trade of the interior an access and
   an outlet under his own control, and open at every season. Of this trade,
   the hides of the buffalo would at first form the staple, and along with
   furs would reward the enterprise till other resources should be developed.</p>
<p>Such were the vast projects that unfolded themselves in the mind of La
   Salle. Canada must needs be, at the outset, his base of action, and without
   the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> support
   of its authorities he could do nothing. This support he found. From the
   moment when Count Frontenac assumed the government of the colony, he seems
   to have looked with favor on the young discoverer. There were points of
   likeness between the two men. Both were ardent, bold, and enterprising.
   The irascible and fiery pride of the noble found its match in the reserved
   and seemingly cold pride of the ambitious burgher. Each could comprehend
   the other; and they had, moreover, strong prejudices and dislikes in common.
   An understanding, not to say an alliance, soon grew up between them.</p>
<div class="sidenote">PROJECTS OF FRONTENAC.</div>
<p>Frontenac had come to Canada a ruined man. He was ostentatious, lavish,
   and in no way disposed to let slip an opportunity of mending his fortune.
   He presently thought that he had found a plan by which he could serve
   both the colony and himself. His predecessor, Courcelle, had urged upon
   the King the expediency of building a fort on Lake Ontario, in order to
   hold the Iroquois in check and intercept the trade which the tribes of
   the Upper Lakes had begun to carry on with the Dutch and English of New
   York. Thus a stream of wealth would be turned into Canada, which would
   otherwise enrich her enemies. Here, to all appearance, was a great public
   good, and from the military point of view it was so in fact; but it was
   clear that the trade thus secured might be made to profit, not the colony
   at large, but those alone who had control of the fort, which would then
   become the instrument of a monopoly. This <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg
   86]</a></span> the governor understood; and, without doubt, he meant
   that the projected establishment should pay him tribute. How far he and
   La Salle were acting in concurrence at this time, it is not easy to say;
   but Frontenac often took counsel of the explorer, who, on his part, saw
   in the design a possible first step towards the accomplishment of his
   own far-reaching schemes.</p>
<div class="sidenote">EXPEDITION OF FRONTENAC</div>
<p>Such of the Canadian merchants as were not in the governor's confidence
   looked on his plan with extreme distrust. Frontenac, therefore, thought
   it expedient "to make use," as he expresses it, "of address." He gave
   out merely that he intended to make a tour through the upper parts of
   the colony with an armed force, in order to inspire the Indians with respect,
   and secure a solid peace. He had neither troops, money, munitions, nor
   means of transportation; yet there was no time to lose, for, should he
   delay the execution of his plan, it might be countermanded by the King.
   His only resource, therefore, was in a prompt and hardy exertion of the
   royal authority; and he issued an order requiring the inhabitants of Quebec,
   Montreal, Three Rivers, and other settlements to furnish him, at their
   own cost, as soon as the spring sowing should be over, with a certain
   number of armed men, besides the requisite canoes. At the same time, he
   invited the officers settled in the country to join the expedition,&mdash;an
   invitation which, anxious as they were to gain his good graces, few of
   them cared to decline. Regardless of murmurs and discontent, he pushed
   his preparation <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg
   87]</a></span> vigorously, and on the third of June left Quebec with
   his guard, his staff, a part of the garrison of the Castle of St. Louis,
   and a number of volunteers. He had already sent to La Salle, who was then
   at Montreal, directing him to repair to Onondaga, the political centre
   of the Iroquois, and invite their sachems to meet the governor in council
   at the Bay of Quint&eacute; on the north of Lake Ontario. La Salle had
   set out on his mission, but first sent Frontenac a map, which convinced
   him that the best site for his proposed fort was the mouth of the Cataraqui,
   where Kingston now stands. Another messenger was accordingly despatched,
   to change the rendezvous to this point.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the governor proceeded at his leisure towards Montreal, stopping
   by the way to visit the officers settled along the bank, who, eager to
   pay their homage to the newly risen sun, received him with a hospitality
   which under the roof of a log hut was sometimes graced by the polished
   courtesies of the salon and the boudoir. Reaching Montreal, which he had
   never before seen, he gazed, we may suppose, with some interest at the
   long row of humble dwellings which lined the bank, the massive buildings
   of the Seminary, and the spire of the church predominant over all. It
   was a rude scene, but the greeting that awaited him savored nothing of
   the rough simplicity of the wilderness. Perrot, the local governor, was
   on the shore with his soldiers and the inhabitants, drawn up under arms
   and firing <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> a
   salute to welcome the representative of the King. Frontenac was compelled
   to listen to a long harangue from the judge of the place, followed by
   another from the syndic. Then there was a solemn procession to the church,
   where he was forced to undergo a third effort of oratory from one of the
   priests. <i>Te Deum</i> followed, in thanks for his arrival; and then
   he took refuge in the fort. Here he remained thirteen days, busied with
   his preparations, organizing the militia, soothing their mutual jealousies,
   and settling knotty questions of rank and precedence. During this time,
   every means, as he declares, was used to prevent him from proceeding;
   and among other devices a rumor was set on foot that a Dutch fleet, having
   just captured Boston, was on its way to attack Quebec.<a name="fnanchor_67" id="fnanchor_67"></a><a href="#footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">FRONTENAC'S JOURNEY</div>
<p>Having sent men, canoes, and baggage, by land, to La Salle's old settlement
   of La Chine, Frontenac himself followed on the twenty-eighth of June.
   Including Indians from the missions, he now had with him about four hundred
   men and a hundred and twenty canoes, besides two large flat-boats, which
   he caused to be painted in red and blue, with strange devices, intended
   to dazzle the Iroquois by a display of unwonted splendor. Now their hard
   task began. Shouldering canoes through the forest, dragging the flat-boats
   along the shore, working like beavers,&mdash;sometimes <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg
   89]</a></span> in water to the knees, sometimes to the armpits, their
   feet cut by the sharp stones, and they themselves well-nigh swept down
   by the furious current,&mdash;they fought their way upward against the
   chain of mighty rapids that break the navigation of the St. Lawrence.
   The Indians were of the greatest service. Frontenac, like La Salle, showed
   from the first a special faculty of managing them; for his keen, incisive
   spirit was exactly to their liking, and they worked for him as they would
   have worked for no man else. As they approached the Long Saut, rain fell
   in torrents; and the governor, without his cloak, and drenched to the
   skin, directed in person the amphibious toil of his followers. Once, it
   is said, he lay awake all night, in his anxiety lest the biscuit should
   be wet, which would have ruined the expedition. No such mischance took
   place, and at length the last rapid was passed, and smooth water awaited
   them to their journey's end. Soon they reached the Thousand Islands, and
   their light flotilla glided in long file among those watery labyrinths,
   by rocky islets, where some lonely pine towered like a mast against the
   sky; by sun-scorched crags, where the brown lichens crisped in the parching
   glare; by deep dells, shady and cool, rich in rank ferns, and spongy,
   dark-green mosses; by still coves, where the water-lilies lay like snow-flakes
   on their broad, flat leaves,&mdash;till at length they neared their goal,
   and the glistening bosom of Lake Ontario opened on their sight.</p>
   <p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg
   90]</a></span></p>
<p>Frontenac, to impose respect on the Iroquois, now set his canoes in order
   of battle. Four divisions formed the first line, then came the two flat-boats;
   he himself, with his guards, his staff, and the gentlemen volunteers,
   followed, with the canoes of Three Rivers on his right, and those of the
   Indians on his left, while two remaining divisions formed a rear line.
   Thus, with measured paddles, they advanced over the still lake, till they
   saw a canoe approaching to meet them. It bore several Iroquois chiefs,
   who told them that the dignitaries of their nation awaited them at Cataraqui,
   and offered to guide them to the spot. They entered the wide mouth of
   the river, and passed along the shore, now covered by the quiet little
   city of Kingston, till they reached the point at present occupied by the
   barracks, at the western end of Cataraqui bridge. Here they stranded their
   canoes and disembarked. Baggage was landed, fires lighted, tents pitched,
   and guards set. Close at hand, under the lee of the forest, were the camping
   sheds of the Iroquois, who had come to the rendezvous in considerable
   numbers.</p>
<div class="sidenote">FRONTENAC AT CATARAQUI</div>
<p>At daybreak of the next morning, the thirteenth of July, the drums beat,
   and the whole party were drawn up under arms. A double line of men extended
   from the front of Frontenac's tent to the Indian camp; and, through the
   lane thus formed, the savage deputies, sixty in number, advanced to the
   place of council. They could not hide their admiration at the martial
   array of the French, many of whom were old <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg
   91]</a></span> soldiers of the regiment of Carignan; and when they reached
   the tent they ejaculated their astonishment at the uniforms of the governor's
   guard who surrounded it. Here the ground had been carpeted with the sails
   of the flat-boats, on which the deputies squatted themselves in a ring
   and smoked their pipes for a time with their usual air of deliberate gravity;
   while Frontenac, who sat surrounded by his officers, had full leisure
   to contemplate the formidable adversaries whose mettle was hereafter to
   put his own to so severe a test. A chief named Garakonti&eacute;, a noted
   friend of the French, at length opened the council, in behalf of all the
   five Iroquois nations, with expressions of great respect and deference
   towards "Onontio;" that is to say, the governor of Canada. Whereupon Frontenac,
   whose native arrogance where Indians were concerned always took a form
   which imposed respect without exciting anger, replied in the following
   strain:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Children! Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, and Senecas. I am glad
   to see you here, where I have had a fire lighted for you to smoke by,
   and for me to talk to you. You have done well, my children, to obey the
   command of your Father. Take courage: you will hear his word, which is
   full of peace and tenderness. For do not think that I have come for war.
   My mind is full of peace, and she walks by my side. Courage, then, children,
   and take rest."</p>
<p>With that, he gave them six fathoms of tobacco, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg
         92]</a></span> reiterated his assurances of friendship, promised
         that he would be a kind father so long as they should be obedient
         children, regretted that he was forced to speak through an interpreter,
         and ended with a gift of guns to the men, and prunes and raisins
         to their wives and children. Here closed this preliminary meeting,
         the great council being postponed to another day.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Raudin, Frontenac's engineer, was tracing out the
   lines of a fort, after a predetermined plan; and the whole party, under
   the direction of their officers, now set themselves to construct it. Some
   cut down trees, some dug the trenches, some hewed the palisades; and with
   such order and alacrity was the work urged on, that the Indians were lost
   in astonishment. Meanwhile, Frontenac spared no pains to make friends
   of the chiefs, some of whom he had constantly at his table. He fondled
   the Iroquois children, and gave them bread and sweetmeats, and in the
   evening feasted the squaws to make them dance. The Indians were delighted
   with these attentions, and conceived a high opinion of the new Onontio.</p>
<div class="sidenote">FRONTENAC AND THE INDIANS.</div>
<p>On the seventeenth, when the construction of the fort was well advanced,
   Frontenac called the chiefs to a grand council, which was held with all
   possible state and ceremony. His dealing with the Indians on this and
   other occasions was truly admirable. Unacquainted as he was with them,
   he seems to have had an instinctive perception of the treatment they required.
   His predecessors had never ventured to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg
   93]</a></span> address the Iroquois as "Children," but had always styled
   them "Brothers;" and yet the assumption of paternal authority on the part
   of Frontenac was not only taken in good part, but was received with apparent
   gratitude. The martial nature of the man, his clear, decisive speech,
   and his frank and downright manner, backed as they were by a display of
   force which in their eyes was formidable, struck them with admiration,
   and gave tenfold effect to his words of kindness. They thanked him for
   that which from another they would not have endured.</p>
<p>Frontenac began by again expressing his satisfaction that they had obeyed
   the commands of their Father, and come to Cataraqui to hear what he had
   to say. Then he exhorted them to embrace Christianity; and on this theme
   he dwelt at length, in words excellently adapted to produce the desired
   effect,&mdash;words which it would be most superfluous to tax as insincere,
   though doubtless they lost nothing in emphasis because in this instance
   conscience and policy aimed alike. Then, changing his tone, he pointed
   to his officers, his guard, the long files of the militia, and the two
   flat-boats, mounted with cannon, which lay in the river near by. "If," he
   said, "your Father can come so far, with so great a force, through such
   dangerous rapids, merely to make you a visit of pleasure and friendship,
   what would he do, if you should awaken his anger, and make it necessary
   for him to punish his disobedient children? He is the arbiter of peace
   and war. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> Beware
   how you offend him!" And he warned them not to molest the Indian allies
   of the French, telling them, sharply, that he would chastise them for
   the least infraction of the peace.</p>
<p>From threats he passed to blandishments, and urged them to confide in
   his paternal kindness, saying that, in proof of his affection, he was
   building a store-house at Cataraqui, where they could be supplied with
   all the goods they needed, without the necessity of a long and dangerous
   journey. He warned them against listening to bad men, who might seek to
   delude them by misrepresentations and falsehoods; and he urged them to
   give heed to none but "men of character, like the Sieur de la Salle." He
   expressed a hope that they would suffer their children to learn French
   from the missionaries, in order that they and his nephews&mdash;meaning
   the French colonists&mdash;might become one people; and he concluded by
   requesting them to give him a number of their children to be educated
   in the French manner, at Quebec.</p>
<div class="sidenote">TREATY WITH THE INDIANS.</div>
<p>This speech, every clause of which was reinforced by abundant presents,
   was extremely well received; though one speaker reminded him that he had
   forgotten one important point, inasmuch as he had not told them at what
   prices they could obtain goods at Cataraqui. Frontenac evaded a precise
   answer, but promised them that the goods should be as cheap as possible,
   in view of the great difficulty of transportation. As to the request concerning
   their children, they said that they could not accede to it till they <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg
   95]</a></span> had talked the matter over in their villages; but it is
   a striking proof of the influence which Frontenac had gained over them,
   that, in the following year, they actually sent several of their children
   to Quebec to be educated,&mdash;the girls among the Ursulines, and the
   boys in the household of the governor.</p>
<p>Three days after the council, the Iroquois set out on their return; and
   as the palisades of the fort were now finished, and the barracks nearly
   so, Frontenac began to send his party homeward by detachments. He himself
   was detained for a time by the arrival of another band of Iroquois, from
   the villages on the north side of Lake Ontario. He repeated to them the
   speech he had made to the others; and, this final meeting over, he embarked
   with his guard, leaving a sufficient number to hold the fort, which was
   to be provisioned for a year by means of a convoy then on its way up the
   river. Passing the rapids safely, he reached Montreal on the first of
   August.</p>
<p>His enterprise had been a complete success. He had gained every point,
   and, in spite of the dangerous navigation, had not lost a single canoe.
   Thanks to the enforced and gratuitous assistance of the inhabitants, the
   whole had cost the King only about ten thousand francs, which Frontenac
   had advanced on his own credit. Though in a commercial point of view the
   new establishment was of very questionable benefit to the colony at large,
   the governor had, nevertheless, conferred an inestimable blessing on all
   Canada by the assurance he had gained of a long <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg
   96]</a></span> respite from the fearful scourge of Iroquois hostility. "Assuredly," he
   writes, "I may boast of having impressed them at once with respect, fear,
   and good-will."<a name="fnanchor_68" id="fnanchor_68"></a><a href="#footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> He adds that the fort at Cataraqui, with the aid of
   a vessel now building, will command Lake Ontario, keep the peace with
   the Iroquois, and cut off the trade with the English; and he proceeds
   to say that by another fort at the mouth of the Niagara, and another vessel
   on Lake Erie, we, the French, can command all the Upper Lakes. This plan
   was an essential link in the schemes of La Salle; and we shall soon find
   him employed in executing it.</p>
<p>A curious incident occurred soon after the building of the fort on Lake
   Ontario. Frontenac, on his way back, quarrelled with Perrot, the governor
   of Montreal, whom, in view of his speculations in the fur-trade, he seems
   to have regarded as a rival in business; but who, by his folly and arrogance,
   would have justified any reasonable measure of severity. Frontenac, however,
   was not reasonable. He arrested Perrot, threw him into prison, and set
   up a man of his own as governor in his place; and as the judge of Montreal
   was not in his interest, he removed him, and substituted another on whom
   he could rely. Thus for a time he had Montreal well in hand.</p>
<p>The priests of the Seminary, seigniors of the island, regarded these arbitrary
   proceedings with extreme uneasiness. They claimed the right of nominating
   their own governor; and Perrot, though he held a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg
   97]</a></span> commission from the King, owed his place to their appointment.
   True, he had set them at nought, and proved a veritable King Stork; yet
   nevertheless they regarded his removal as an infringement of their rights.</p>
<p>During the quarrel with Perrot, La Salle chanced to be at Montreal, lodged
   in the house of Jacques Le Ber, who, though one of the principal merchants
   and most influential inhabitants of the settlement, was accustomed to
   sell goods across his counter in person to white men and Indians, his
   wife taking his place when he was absent. Such were the primitive manners
   of the secluded little colony. Le Ber, at this time, was in the interest
   of Frontenac and La Salle; though he afterwards became one of their most
   determined opponents. Amid the excitement and discussion occasioned by
   Perrot's arrest, La Salle declared himself an adherent of the governor,
   and warned all persons against speaking ill of him in his hearing.</p>
<div class="sidenote">ABB&Eacute; F&Eacute;NELON.</div>
<p>The Abb&eacute; F&eacute;nelon, already mentioned as half-brother to the
   famous Archbishop, had attempted to mediate between Frontenac and Perrot,
   and to this end had made a journey to Quebec on the ice, in midwinter.
   Being of an ardent temperament, and more courageous than prudent, he had
   spoken somewhat indiscreetly, and had been very roughly treated by the
   stormy and imperious Count. He returned to Montreal greatly excited, and
   not without cause. It fell to his lot to preach the Easter sermon. The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg
   98]</a></span> service was held in the little church of the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu,
   which was crowded to the porch, all the chief persons of the settlement
   being present. The cur&eacute; of the parish, whose name also was Perrot,
   said High Mass, assisted by La Salle's brother, Cavelier, and two other
   priests. Then F&eacute;nelon mounted the pulpit. Certain passages of his
   sermon were obviously levelled against Frontenac. Speaking of the duties
   of those clothed with temporal authority, he said that the magistrate,
   inspired with the spirit of Christ, was as ready to pardon offences against
   himself as to punish those against his prince; that he was full of respect
   for the ministers of the altar, and never maltreated them when they attempted
   to reconcile enemies and restore peace; that he never made favorites of
   those who flattered him, nor under specious pretexts oppressed other persons
   in authority who opposed his enterprises; that he used his power to serve
   his king, and not to his own advantage; that he remained content with
   his salary, without disturbing the commerce of the country, or abusing
   those who refused him a share in their profits; and that he never troubled
   the people by inordinate and unjust levies of men and material, using
   the name of his prince as a cover to his own designs.<a name="fnanchor_69" id="fnanchor_69"></a><a href="#footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>
   <p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg
   99]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE AND F&Eacute;NELON.</div>
<p>La Salle sat near the door; but as the preacher proceeded he suddenly
   rose to his feet in such a manner as to attract the notice of the congregation.
   As they turned their heads, he signed to the principal persons among them,
   and by his angry looks and gesticulation called their attention to the
   words of F&eacute;nelon. Then meeting the eye of the cur&eacute;, who
   sat beside the altar, he made the same signs to him, to which the cur&eacute; replied
   by a deprecating shrug of the shoulders. F&eacute;nelon changed color,
   but continued his sermon.<a name="fnanchor_70" id="fnanchor_70"></a><a href="#footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>
<p>This indecent proceeding of La Salle, and the zeal with which throughout
   the quarrel he took the part of the governor, did not go unrewarded. Henceforth,
   Frontenac was more than ever his friend; and this plainly appeared in
   the disposition made, through his influence, of the new fort on Lake Ontario.
   Attempts had been made to induce the king to have it demolished; but it
   was resolved at last that, being built, it should be allowed to stand;
   and, after long delay, a final arrangement was made for its maintenance,
   in the manner following: In the autumn of 1674, La Salle went to France,
   with letters of strong recommendation from Frontenac.<a name="fnanchor_71" id="fnanchor_71"></a><a href="#footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> He was well <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg
   100]</a></span> received at Court; and he made two petitions to the King,&mdash;the
   one for a patent of nobility, in consideration of his services as an explorer;
   and the other for a grant in seigniory of Fort Frontenac, for so he called
   the new post, in honor of his patron. On his part, he offered to pay back
   the ten thousand francs which the fort had cost the King; to maintain
   it at his own charge, with a garrison equal to that of Montreal, besides
   fifteen or twenty laborers; to form a French colony around it; to build
   a church, whenever the number of inhabitants should reach one hundred;
   and, meanwhile, to support one or more R&eacute;collet friars; and, finally,
   to form a settlement of domesticated Indians in the neighborhood. His
   offers were accepted. He was raised to the rank of the untitled nobles;
   received a grant of the fort and lands adjacent, to the extent of four
   leagues in front and half a league in depth, besides the neighboring islands;
   and was invested with the government of the fort and settlement, subject
   to the orders of the governor-general.<a name="fnanchor_72" id="fnanchor_72"></a><a href="#footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg
   101]</a></span></p>
<p>La Salle returned to Canada, proprietor of a seigniory which, all things
   considered, was one of the most valuable in the colony. His friends and
   his family, rejoicing in his good fortune and not unwilling to share it,
   made him large advances of money, enabling him to pay the stipulated sum
   to the King, to rebuild the fort in stone, maintain soldiers and laborers,
   and procure in part, at least, the necessary outfit. Had La Salle been
   a mere merchant, he was in a fair way to make a fortune, for he was in
   a position to control the better part of the Canadian fur-trade. But he
   was not a mere merchant; and no commercial profit could content his ambition.</p>
<p>Those may believe, who will, that Frontenac did not expect a share in
   the profits of the new post. That he did expect it, there is positive
   evidence; for a deposition is extant, taken at the instance of his enemy
   the Intendant Duchesneau, in which three witnesses attest that the governor,
   La Salle, his lieutenant La Forest, and one Boisseau, had formed a partnership
   to carry on the trade of Fort Frontenac.</p>
<div class="sidenote">ENEMIES OF LA SALLE.</div>
<p>No sooner was La Salle installed in his new post than the merchants of
   Canada joined hands to oppose him. Le Ber, once his friend, became his
   bitter enemy; for he himself had hoped to share the monopoly of Fort Frontenac,
   of which he and one Bazire had at first been placed provisionally in control, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg
   102]</a></span> and from which he now saw himself ejected. La Chesnaye,
   Le Moyne, and others of more or less influence took part in the league,
   which, in fact, embraced all the traders in the colony except the few
   joined with Frontenac and La Salle. Duchesneau, intendant of the colony,
   aided the malcontents. As time went on, their bitterness grew more bitter;
   and when at last it was seen that, not satisfied with the monopoly of
   Fort Frontenac, La Salle aimed at the control of the valleys of the Ohio
   and the Mississippi, and the usufruct of half a continent, the ire of
   his opponents redoubled, and Canada became for him a nest of hornets,
   buzzing in wrath and watching the moment to sting. But there was another
   element of opposition, less noisy, but not less formidable; and this arose
   from the Jesuits. Frontenac hated them; and they, under befitting forms
   of duty and courtesy, paid him back in the same coin. Having no love for
   the governor, they would naturally have little for his partisan and <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>;
   but their opposition had another and a deeper root, for the plans of the
   daring young schemer jarred with their own.</p>
<div class="sidenote">PURPOSES OF THE JESUITS.</div>
<p>We have seen the Canadian Jesuits in the early apostolic days of their
   mission, when the flame of their zeal, fed by an ardent hope, burned bright
   and high. This hope was doomed to disappointment. Their avowed purpose
   of building another Paraguay on the borders of the Great Lakes<a name="fnanchor_73" id="fnanchor_73"></a><a href="#footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> was
   never accomplished, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg
   103]</a></span> and their missions and their converts were swept away
   in an avalanche of ruin. Still, they would not despair. From the lakes
   they turned their eyes to the Valley of the Mississippi, in the hope to
   see it one day the seat of their new empire of the Faith. But what did
   this new Paraguay mean? It meant a little nation of converted and domesticated
   savages, docile as children, under the paternal and absolute rule of Jesuit
   fathers, and trained by them in industrial pursuits, the results of which
   were to inure, not to the profit of the producers, but to the building
   of churches, the founding of colleges, the establishment of warehouses
   and magazines, and the construction of works of defence,&mdash;all controlled
   by Jesuits, and forming a part of the vast possessions of the Order. Such
   was the old Paraguay;<a name="fnanchor_74" id="fnanchor_74"></a><a href="#footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and such, we may suppose, would have been the
   new, had the plans of those who designed it been realized.</p>
<p>I have said that since the middle of the century the religious exaltation
   of the early missions had sensibly declined. In the nature of things,
   that grand enthusiasm was too intense and fervent to be long sustained.
   But the vital force of Jesuitism had suffered no diminution. That marvellous <i>esprit
   de corps</i>, that extinction of self and absorption of the individual
   in the Order which has marked the Jesuits from their first existence as
   a body, was no whit changed or lessened,&mdash;a principle, which, though <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg
   104]</a></span> different, was no less strong than the self-devoted patriotism
   of Sparta or the early Roman Republic.</p>
<p>The Jesuits were no longer supreme in Canada; or, in other words, Canada
   was no longer simply a mission. It had become a colony. Temporal interests
   and the civil power were constantly gaining ground; and the disciples
   of Loyola felt that relatively, if not absolutely, they were losing it.
   They struggled vigorously to maintain the ascendency of their Order, or,
   as they would have expressed it, the ascendency of religion; but in the
   older and more settled parts of the colony it was clear that the day of
   their undivided rule was past. Therefore, they looked with redoubled solicitude
   to their missions in the West. They had been among its first explorers;
   and they hoped that here the Catholic Faith, as represented by Jesuits,
   might reign with undisputed sway. In Paraguay, it was their constant aim
   to exclude white men from their missions. It was the same in North America.
   They dreaded fur-traders, partly because they interfered with their teachings
   and perverted their converts, and partly for other reasons. But La Salle
   was a fur-trader, and far worse than a fur-trader: he aimed at occupation,
   fortification, and settlement. The scope and vigor of his enterprises,
   and the powerful influence that aided them, made him a stumbling-block
   in their path. He was their most dangerous rival for the control of the
   West, and from first to last they set themselves against him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE'S MEMOIR.</div>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most curious monuments of La Salle's time is a long memoir,
   written by a person who made his acquaintance at Paris in the summer of
   1678, when, as we shall soon see, he had returned to France in prosecution
   of his plans. The writer knew the Sulpitian Galin&eacute;e,<a name="fnanchor_75" id="fnanchor_75"></a><a href="#footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> who, as
   he says, had a very high opinion of La Salle; and he was also in close
   relations with the discoverer's patron, the Prince de Conti.<a name="fnanchor_76" id="fnanchor_76"></a><a href="#footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> He says
   that he had ten or twelve interviews with La Salle; and, becoming interested
   in him and in that which he communicated, he wrote down the substance
   of his conversation. The paper is divided into two <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg
   107]</a></span> parts: the first, called "M&eacute;moire sur Mr. de la
   Salle," is devoted to the state of affairs in Canada, and chiefly to the
   Jesuits; the second, entitled "Histoire de Mr. de la Salle," is an account
   of the discoverer's life, or as much of it as the writer had learned from
   him.<a name="fnanchor_77" id="fnanchor_77"></a><a href="#footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Both parts bear throughout the internal evidence of being what
   they profess to be; but they embody the statements of a man of intense
   partisan feeling, transmitted through the mind of another person in sympathy
   with him, and evidently sharing his prepossessions. In one respect, however,
   the paper is of unquestionable historical value; for it gives us a vivid
   and not an exaggerated picture of the bitter strife of parties which then
   raged in Canada, and which was destined to tax to the utmost the vast
   energy and fortitude of La Salle. At times, the memoir is fully sustained
   by contemporary evidence; but often, again, it rests on its own unsupported
   authority. I give an abstract of its statements as I find them.</p>
<p>The following is the writer's account of La Salle: "All those among my
   friends who have seen him find him a man of great intelligence and sense.
   He rarely speaks of any subject except when questioned about it, and his
   words are very few and very precise. He distinguishes perfectly between
   that which he knows with certainly and that which he knows with some mingling
   of doubt. When he does not know, he does <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg
   108]</a></span> not hesitate to avow it; and though I have heard him say
   the same thing more than five or six times, when persons were present
   who had not heard it before, he always said it in the same manner. In
   short, I never heard anybody speak whose words carried with them more
   marks of truth."<a name="fnanchor_78" id="fnanchor_78"></a><a href="#footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">JESUIT ASCENDENCY.</div>
<p>After mentioning that he is thirty-three or thirty-four years old, and
   that he has been twelve years in America, the memoir declares that he
   made the following statements: that the Jesuits are masters at Quebec;
   that the bishop is their creature, and does nothing but in concert with
   them;<a name="fnanchor_79" id="fnanchor_79"></a><a href="#footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> that he is not well inclined towards the R&eacute;collets,<a name="fnanchor_80" id="fnanchor_80"></a><a href="#footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
   who have little <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg
   109]</a></span> credit, but who are protected by Frontenac; that in Canada
   the Jesuits think everybody an enemy to religion who is an enemy to them;
   that, though they refused absolution to all who sold brandy to the Indians,
   they sold it themselves, and that he, La Salle, had himself detected them
   in it;<a name="fnanchor_81" id="fnanchor_81"></a><a href="#footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> that the bishop laughs at the orders of the King when they
   do not agree with the wishes of the Jesuits; that the Jesuits dismissed
   one of their servants named Robert, because he told of their trade in
   brandy; that Albanel,<a name="fnanchor_82" id="fnanchor_82"></a><a href="#footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> in particular, carried on a great fur-trade,
   and that the Jesuits have built their college in part from the profits
   of this kind of traffic; that they <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg
   110]</a></span> admitted that they carried on a trade, but denied that
   they gained so much by it as was commonly supposed.<a name="fnanchor_83" id="fnanchor_83"></a><a href="#footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">FEMALE INQUISITORS.</div>
<p>The memoir proceeds to affirm that they trade largely with the Sioux at
   Ste. Marie, and with other tribes at Michilimackinac, and that they are
   masters of the trade of that region, where the forts are in their possession.<a name="fnanchor_84" id="fnanchor_84"></a><a href="#footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
   An Indian said, in full council, at Quebec, that he had prayed and been
   a Christian as long as the Jesuits would stay and teach him, but since
   no more beaver were left in his country, the missionaries were gone also.
   The Jesuits, pursues the memoir, will have no priests but themselves in
   their missions, and call them all Jansenists, not excepting the priests
   of St. Sulpice.</p>
<p>The bishop is next accused of harshness and intolerance, as well as of
   growing rich by tithes, and even by trade, in which it is affirmed he
   has a covert interest.<a name="fnanchor_85" id="fnanchor_85"></a><a href="#footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> It is added that there exists in Quebec, under
   the auspices of the Jesuits, an association <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg
   111]</a></span> called the Sainte Famille, of which Madame Bourdon<a name="fnanchor_86" id="fnanchor_86"></a><a href="#footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
   is superior. They meet in the cathedral every Thursday, with closed doors,
   where they relate to each other&mdash;as they are bound by a vow to do&mdash;all
   they have learned, whether good or evil, concerning other people, during
   the week. It is a sort of female inquisition, for the benefit of the Jesuits,
   the secrets of whose friends, it is said, are kept, while no such discretion
   is observed with regard to persons not of their party.<a name="fnanchor_87" id="fnanchor_87"></a><a href="#footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg
   112]</a></span></p>
<p>Here follow a series of statements which it is needless to repeat, as
   they do not concern La Salle. They relate to abuse of the confessional,
   hostility to other priests, hostility to civil authorities, and over-hasty
   baptisms, in regard to which La Salle is reported to have made a comparison,
   unfavorable to the Jesuits, between them and the R&eacute;collets and
   Sulpitians.</p>
<div class="sidenote">PLOTS AGAINST LA SALLE.</div>
<p>We now come to the second part of the memoir, entitled "History of Monsieur
   de la Salle." After stating that he left France at the age of twenty-one
   or twenty-two, with the purpose of attempting some new discovery, it makes
   the statements repeated in a former chapter, concerning his discovery
   of the Ohio, the Illinois, and possibly the Mississippi. It then mentions
   the building of Fort Frontenac, and says that one object of it was to
   prevent the Jesuits from becoming undisputed masters of the fur-trade.<a name="fnanchor_88" id="fnanchor_88"></a><a href="#footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
   Three years ago, it pursues, La Salle came to France, and obtained a grant
   of the fort; and it proceeds to give examples of the means used by the
   party opposed to him to injure his good name and bring him within reach
   of the law. Once, when he was at Quebec, the farmer of the King's revenue,
   one of the richest <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg
   113]</a></span> men in the place, was extremely urgent in his proffers
   of hospitality, and at length, though he knew La Salle but slightly, persuaded
   him to lodge in his house. He had been here but a few days when his host's
   wife began to enact the part of the wife of Potiphar, and this with so
   much vivacity that on one occasion La Salle was forced to take an abrupt
   leave, in order to avoid an infringement of the laws of hospitality. As
   he opened the door, he found the husband on the watch, and saw that it
   was a plot to entrap him.<a name="fnanchor_89" id="fnanchor_89"></a><a href="#footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>
<p>Another attack, of a different character, though in the same direction,
   was soon after made. The remittances which La Salle received from the
   various members and connections of his family were sent through the hands
   of his brother, Abb&eacute; Cavelier, from whom his enemies were, therefore,
   very eager to alienate him. To this end, a report was made to reach the
   priest's ears that La Salle had seduced a young woman, with whom he was
   living in an open and scandalous manner at Fort Frontenac. The effect
   of this device exceeded the wishes of its contrivers; for the priest,
   aghast at what he had heard, set out for the fort, to administer his fraternal
   rebuke, but on arriving, in place of the expected abomination, found his
   brother, assisted by two R&eacute;collet friars, ruling with edifying
   propriety over a most exemplary household.</p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg
   114]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus far the memoir. From passages in some of La Salle's letters, it may
   be gathered that Abb&eacute; Cavelier gave him at times no little annoyance.
   In his double character of priest and elder brother, he seems to have
   constituted himself the counsellor, monitor, and guide of a man who, though
   many years his junior, was in all respects incomparably superior to him,
   as the sequel will show. This must have been almost insufferable to a
   nature like that of La Salle, who, nevertheless, was forced to arm himself
   with patience, since his brother held the purse-strings. On one occasion
   his forbearance was put to a severe proof, when, wishing to marry a damsel
   of good connections in the colony, Abb&eacute; Cavelier saw fit for some
   reason to interfere, and prevented the alliance.<a name="fnanchor_90" id="fnanchor_90"></a><a href="#footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">INTRIGUES OF THE JESUITS.</div>
<p>To resume the memoir. It declares that the Jesuits procured an ordinance
   from the Supreme Council prohibiting traders from going into the Indian
   country, in order that they, the Jesuits, being already established there
   in their missions, might carry on trade without competition. But La Salle
   induced a good number of the Iroquois to settle around his fort; thus
   bringing the trade to his own door, without breaking the ordinance. These
   Iroquois, he is further reported to have said, were very fond of him,
   and aided him in rebuilding the fort with cut stone. The Jesuits told
   the Iroquois on the south side of the lake, where they were established <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg
   115]</a></span> as missionaries, that La Salle was strengthening his defences
   with the view of making war on them. They and the intendant, who was their
   creature, endeavored to embroil the Iroquois with the French in order
   to ruin La Salle; writing to him at the same time that he was the bulwark
   of the country, and that he ought to be always on his guard. They also
   tried to persuade Frontenac that it was necessary to raise men and prepare
   for war. La Salle suspected them; and seeing that the Iroquois, in consequence
   of their intrigues, were in an excited state, he induced the governor
   to come to Fort Frontenac to pacify them. He accordingly did so; and a
   council was held, which ended in a complete restoration of confidence
   on the part of the Iroquois.<a name="fnanchor_91" id="fnanchor_91"></a><a href="#footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> At this council they accused the two
   Jesuits, Bruyas and Pierron,<a name="fnanchor_92" id="fnanchor_92"></a><a href="#footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> of spreading reports that the French
   were preparing to attack them. La Salle thought that the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg
   116]</a></span> object of the intrigue was to make the Iroquois jealous
   of him, and engage Frontenac in expenses which would offend the King.
   After La Salle and the governor had lost credit by the rupture, the Jesuits
   would come forward as pacificators, in the full assurance that they could
   restore quiet, and appear in the attitude of saviors of the colony.</p>
<p>La Salle, pursues his reporter, went on to say that about this time a
   quantity of hemlock and verdigris was given him in a salad; and that the
   guilty person was a man in his employ named Nicolas Perrot, otherwise
   called Jolyc&oelig;ur, who confessed the crime.<a name="fnanchor_93" id="fnanchor_93"></a><a href="#footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The memoir adds that
   La Salle, who recovered from the effects of the poison, wholly exculpates
   the Jesuits.</p>
<p>This attempt, which was not, as we shall see, the only one of the kind
   made against La Salle, is alluded to by him in a letter to a friend at
   Paris, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> written
   in Canada when he was on the point of departure on his great expedition
   to descend the Mississippi. The following is an extract from it:</p>
<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE EXCULPATES THE JESUITS.</div>
<p>"I hope to give myself the honor of sending you a more particular account
   of this enterprise when it shall have had the success which I hope for
   it; but I have need of a strong protection for its support. It traverses
   the commercial operations of certain persons, who will find it hard to
   endure it. They intended to make a new Paraguay in these parts, and the
   route which I close against them gave them facilities for an advantageous
   correspondence with Mexico. This check will infallibly be a mortification
   to them; and you know how they deal with whatever opposes them. <i>Nevertheless,
   I am bound to render them the justice to say that the poison which was
   given me was not at all of their instigation.</i> The person who was conscious
   of the guilt, believing that I was their enemy because he saw that our
   sentiments were opposed, thought to exculpate himself by accusing them,
   and I confess that at the time I was not sorry to have this indication
   of their ill-will; but having afterwards carefully examined the affair,
   I clearly discovered the falsity of the accusation which this rascal had
   made against them. I nevertheless pardoned him, in order not to give notoriety
   to the affair; as the mere suspicion might sully their reputation, to
   which I should scrupulously avoid doing the slightest injury unless I
   thought it necessary to the good of the public, and unless the fact were
   fully proved. Therefore, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg
   118]</a></span> Monsieur, if anybody shared the suspicion which I felt,
   oblige me by undeceiving him."<a name="fnanchor_94" id="fnanchor_94"></a><a href="#footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>
<p>This letter, so honorable to La Salle, explains the statement made in
   the memoir, that, notwithstanding his grounds of complaint against the
   Jesuits, he continued to live on terms of courtesy with them, entertained
   them at his fort, and occasionally corresponded with them. The writer
   asserts, however, that they intrigued with his men to induce them to desert,&mdash;employing
   for this purpose a young man named Deslauriers, whom they sent to him
   with letters of recommendation. La Salle took him into his service; but
   he soon after escaped, with several other men, and took refuge in the
   Jesuit missions.<a name="fnanchor_95" id="fnanchor_95"></a><a href="#footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The object of the intrigue is said to have been the
   reduction of La Salle's garrison to a number less than that which he was
   bound to maintain, thus exposing him to a forfeiture of his title of possession.</p>
<div class="sidenote">RENEWED INTRIGUES.</div>
<p>He is also stated to have declared that Louis Joliet was an impostor,<a name="fnanchor_96" id="fnanchor_96"></a><a href="#footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
   and a <i>donn&eacute;</i> of the Jesuits,&mdash;that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg
   119]</a></span> is, a man who worked for them without pay; and, further,
   that when he, La Salle, came to court to ask for privileges enabling him
   to pursue his discoveries, the Jesuits represented in advance to the minister
   Colbert that his head was turned, and that he was fit for nothing but
   a mad-house. It was only by the aid of influential friends that he was
   at length enabled to gain an audience.</p>
<p>Here ends this remarkable memoir, which, criticise it as we may, does
   not exaggerate the jealousies and enmities that beset the path of the
   discoverer.</p>

      done, in your voyage to Fort Frontenac, to reconcile the minds of the
      Five Iroquois Nations, and to clear yourself from the suspicions they
      had entertained, and from the motives that might induce them to make
      war." Frontenac's despatches of this year, as well as of the preceding
      and following years, are missing from the archives.</p>
   <p>In a memoir written in November, 1680, La Salle alludes to "le d&eacute;sir

<p>"<span class="smcap">If</span>," writes a friend of La Salle," he had preferred gain to glory,
   he had only to stay at his fort, where he was making more than twenty-five
   thousand livres a year."<a name="fnanchor_97" id="fnanchor_97"></a><a href="#footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> He loved solitude and he loved power; and
   at Fort Frontenac he had both, so far as each consisted with the other.
   The nearest settlement was a week's journey distant, and he was master
   of all around him. He had spared no pains to fulfil the conditions on
   which his wilderness seigniory had been granted, and within two years
   he had demolished the original wooden fort, replacing it by another much
   larger, enclosed on the land side by ramparts and bastions of stone, and
   on the water side by palisades. It contained a range of barracks of squared
   timber, a guard-house, a lodging for officers, a forge, a well, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg
   121]</a></span> a mill, and a bakery. Nine small cannon were mounted on
   the walls. Two officers and a surgeon, with ten or twelve soldiers, made
   up the garrison; and three or four times that number of masons, laborers,
   and canoe-men were at one time maintained at the place.</p>
<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE AT FORT FRONTENAC.</div>
<p>Along the shore south of the fort was a small village of French families,
   to whom La Salle had granted farms, and, farther on, a village of Iroquois,
   whom he had persuaded to settle here. Near these villages were the house
   and chapel of two R&eacute;collet friars, Luc Buisset and Louis Hennepin.
   More than a hundred French acres of land had been cleared of wood, and
   planted in part with crops; while cattle, fowls, and swine had been brought
   up from Montreal. Four vessels, of from twenty-five to forty tons, had
   been built for the lake and the river; but canoes served best for ordinary
   uses, and La Salle's followers became so skilled in managing them that
   they were reputed the best canoe-men in America. Feudal lord of the forests
   around him, commander of a garrison raised and paid by himself, founder
   of the mission, and patron of the church, he reigned the autocrat of his
   lonely little empire.<a name="fnanchor_98" id="fnanchor_98"></a><a href="#footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg

<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE'S MEMORIAL.</div>
<p>It was not solely or chiefly for commercial gain that La Salle had established
   Fort Frontenac. He regarded it as a first step towards greater things;
   and now, at length, his plans were ripe and his time was come. In the
   autumn of 1677 he left the fort in charge of his lieutenant, descended
   the St. Lawrence to Quebec, and sailed for France. He had the patronage
   of Frontenac and the help of strong friends in Paris. It is said, as we
   have seen already, that his enemies denounced him, in advance, as a madman;
   but a memorial of his, which his friends laid before the minister Colbert,
   found a favorable hearing. In it he set forth his plans, or a portion
   of them. He first recounted briefly the discoveries he had made, and then
   described the country he had seen south and west of the great lakes. "It
   is nearly all so beautiful and so fertile; so free from forests, and so
   full of meadows, brooks, and rivers; so abounding in fish, game, and venison,
   that one can find there in plenty, and with little trouble, all that is
   needful for the support of flourishing colonies. The soil will produce
   everything that is raised in France. Flocks and herds can be left out
   at pasture all winter; and there are even native wild cattle, which, instead
   of hair, have a fine wool that may answer for making cloth and hats. Their
   hides are better than those of France, as appears <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg
   123]</a></span> by the sample which the Sieur de la Salle has brought
   with him. Hemp and cotton grow here naturally, and may be manufactured
   with good results; so there can be no doubt that colonies planted here
   would become very prosperous. They would be increased by a great number
   of western Indians, who are in the main of a tractable and social disposition;
   and as they have the use neither of our weapons nor of our goods, and
   are not in intercourse with other Europeans, they will readily adapt themselves
   to us and imitate our way of life as soon as they taste the advantages
   of our friendship and of the commodities we bring them, insomuch that
   these countries will infallibly furnish, within a few years, a great many
   new subjects to the Church and the King.</p>
<p>"It was the knowledge of these things, joined to the poverty of Canada,
   its dense forests, its barren soil, its harsh climate, and the snow that
   covers the ground for half the year, that led the Sieur de la Salle to
   undertake the planting of colonies in these beautiful countries of the
   West."</p>
<p>Then he recounts the difficulties of the attempt,&mdash;the vast distances,
   the rapids and cataracts that obstruct the way; the cost of men, provisions,
   and munitions; the danger from the Iroquois, and the rivalry of the English,
   who covet the western country, and would gladly seize it for themselves. "But
   this last reason," says the memorial, "only animates the Sieur de la Salle
   the more, and impels <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg
   124]</a></span> him to anticipate them by the promptness of his action."</p>
<p>He declares that it was for this that he had asked for the grant of Fort
   Frontenac; and he describes what he had done at that post, in order to
   make it a secure basis for his enterprise. He says that he has now overcome
   the chief difficulties in his way, and that he is ready to plant a new
   colony at the outlet of Lake Erie, of which the English, if not prevented,
   might easily take possession. Towards the accomplishment of his plans,
   he asks the confirmation of his title to Fort Frontenac, and the permission
   to establish at his own cost two other posts, with seigniorial rights
   over all lands which he may discover and colonize within twenty years,
   and the government of all the country in question. On his part, he proposes
   to renounce all share in the trade carried on between the tribes of the
   Upper Lakes and the people of Canada.</p>
<p>La Salle seems to have had an interview with the minister, in which the
   proposals of his memorial were somewhat modified. He soon received in
   reply the following patent from the King:&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE KING'S APPROVAL.</div>
<p>"Louis, by the grace of God King of France and Navarre, to our dear and
   well-beloved Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle, greeting. We have received
   with favor the very humble petition made us in your name, to permit you
   to labor at the discovery of the western parts of New France; and we have
   the more willingly entertained this proposal, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg
   125]</a></span> since we have nothing more at heart than the exploration
   of this country, through which, to all appearance, a way may be found
   to Mexico.... For this and other causes thereunto moving us, we permit
   you by these presents, signed with our hand, to labor at the discovery
   of the western parts of our aforesaid country of New France; and, for
   the execution of this enterprise, to build forts at such places as you
   may think necessary, and enjoy possession thereof under the same clauses
   and conditions as of Fort Frontenac, conformably to our letters patent
   of May thirteenth, 1675, which, so far as needful, we confirm by these
   presents. And it is our will that they be executed according to their
   form and tenor: on condition, nevertheless, that you finish this enterprise
   within five years, failing which, these presents shall be void, and of
   no effect; that you carry on no trade with the savages called Ottawas,
   or with other tribes who bring their peltries to Montreal; and that you
   do the whole at your own cost and that of your associates, to whom we
   have granted the sole right of trade in buffalo-hides. And we direct the
   Sieur Count Frontenac, our governor and lieutenant-general, and also Duchesneau,
   intendant of justice, police, and finance, and the officers of the supreme
   council of the aforesaid country, to see to the execution of these presents;
   for such is our pleasure.</p>
<p>"Given at St. Germain en Laye, this 12th day of May, 1678, and of our
   reign the 35th year."</p>
<p>This patent grants both more and less than the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg
         126]</a></span> memorial had asked. It authorizes La Salle to build
         and own, not two forts only, but as many as he may see fit, provided
         that he do so within five years; and it gives him, besides, the
         monopoly of buffalo-hides, for which at first he had not petitioned.
         Nothing is said of colonies. To discover the country, secure it
         by forts, and find, if possible, a way to Mexico, are the only object
         set forth; for Louis XIV. always discountenanced settlement in the
         West, partly as tending to deplete Canada, and partly as removing
         his subjects too far from his paternal control. It was but the year
         before that he refused to Louis Joliet the permission to plant a
         trading station in the Valley of the Mississippi.<a name="fnanchor_99" id="fnanchor_99"></a><a href="#footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> La Salle,
         however, still held to his plan of a commercial and industrial colony,
         and in connection with it to another purpose, of which his memorial
         had made no mention. This was the building of a vessel on some branch
         of the Mississippi, in order to sail down that river to its mouth,
         and open a route to commerce through the Gulf of Mexico. It is evident
         that this design was already formed; for he had no sooner received
         his patent, than he engaged ship-carpenters, and procured iron,
         cordage, and anchors, not for one vessel, but for two.</p>
<div class="sidenote">MONEY AND MEANS.</div>
<p>What he now most needed was money; and having none of his own, he set
   himself to raising it from others. A notary named Simonnet lent him four
   thousand livres; an advocate named Raoul, twenty-four <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg
   127]</a></span> thousand; and one Dumont, six thousand. His cousin Fran&ccedil;ois
   Plet, a merchant of Rue St. Martin, lent him about eleven thousand, at
   the interest of forty per cent; and when he returned to Canada, Frontenac
   found means to procure him another loan of about fourteen thousand, secured
   by the mortgage of Fort Frontenac. But his chief helpers were his family,
   who became sharers in his undertaking. "His brothers and relations," says
   a memorial afterwards addressed by them to the King, "spared nothing to
   enable him to respond worthily to the royal goodness;" and the document
   adds, that, before his allotted five years were ended, his discoveries
   had cost them more than five hundred thousand livres (francs).<a name="fnanchor_100" id="fnanchor_100"></a><a href="#footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> La
   Salle himself believed, and made others believe, that there was more profit
   than risk in his schemes.</p>
<p>Lodged rather obscurely in Rue de la Truanderie, and of a nature reserved
   and shy, he nevertheless found countenance and support from personages
   no less exalted than Colbert, Seignelay, and the Prince de Conti. Others,
   too, in stations less conspicuous, warmly espoused his cause, and none
   more so than the learned Abb&eacute; Renaudot, who helped him with tongue
   and pen, and seems to have been instrumental in introducing to him a man
   who afterwards proved invaluable. This was Henri de Tonty, an Italian <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg
   128]</a></span> officer, a <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of the Prince
   de Conti, who sent him to La Salle as a person suited to his purposes,
   Tonty had but one hand, the other having been blown off by a grenade in
   the Sicilian wars.<a name="fnanchor_101" id="fnanchor_101"></a><a href="#footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> His father, who had been governor of Gaeta, but
   who had come to France in consequence of political disturbances in Naples,
   had earned no small reputation as a financier, and had invented the form
   of life insurance still called the Tontine. La Salle learned to know his
   new lieutenant on the voyage across the Atlantic; and, soon after reaching
   Canada, he wrote of him to his patron in the following terms: "His honorable
   character and his amiable disposition were well known to you; but perhaps
   you would not have thought him capable of doing things for which a strong
   constitution, an acquaintance with the country, and the use of both hands
   seemed absolutely necessary. Nevertheless, his energy and address make
   him equal to anything; and now, at a season when everybody is in fear
   of the ice, he is setting out to begin a new fort, two hundred leagues
   from this place, and to which I have taken the liberty to give the name
   of Fort Conti. It is situated near that great cataract, more than a hundred
   and twenty <i>toises</i> in height, by which the lakes of higher elevation
   precipitate themselves into Lake Frontenac [Ontario]. From there one goes
   by water, five hundred leagues, to the place where Fort Dauphin is to
   be begun; from which it only remains to descend the great <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg
   129]</a></span> river of the Bay of St. Esprit, to reach the Gulf of Mexico."<a name="fnanchor_102" id="fnanchor_102"></a><a href="#footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">RETURN TO CANADA.</div>
<p>Besides Tonty, La Salle found in France another ally, La Motte de Lussi&egrave;re,
   to whom he offered a share in the enterprise, and who joined him at Rochelle,
   the place of embarkation. Here vexatious delays occurred. Bellinzani,
   director of trade, who had formerly taken lessons in rascality in the
   service of Cardinal Mazarin, abused his official position to throw obstacles
   in the way of La Salle, in order to extort money from him; and he extorted,
   in fact, a considerable sum, which his victim afterwards reclaimed. It
   was not till the fourteenth of July that La Salle, with Tonty, La Motte,
   and thirty men, set sail for Canada, and two months more elapsed before
   he reached Quebec. Here, to increase his resources and strengthen his
   position, he seems to have made a league with several Canadian merchants, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg
   130]</a></span> some of whom had before been his enemies, and were to
   be so again. Here, too, he found Father Louis Hennepin, who had come down
   from Fort Frontenac to meet him.<a name="fnanchor_103" id="fnanchor_103"></a><a href="#footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

      been built on the site of the present Fort Niagara. The name of Lac
      de Conti was given by La Salle to Lake Erie. The fort mentioned as
      Fort Dauphin was built, as we shall see, on the Illinois, though under
      another name. La Salle, deceived by Spanish maps, thought that the
      Mississippi discharged itself into the Bay of St. Esprit (Mobile Bay).</p>
   <p>Henri de Tonty signed his name in the Gallicized, and not in the original
      Italian form <i>Tonti</i>. He wore a hand of iron or some other metal,
      which was usually covered with a glove. La Potherie says that he once
      or twice used it to good purpose when the Indians became disorderly,
      in breaking the heads of the most contumacious or knocking out their
      teeth. Not knowing at the time the secret of the unusual efficacy of
      his blows, they regarded him as a "medicine" of the first order. La
      Potherie erroneously ascribes the loss of his hand to a sabre-cut received
      in a <i>sortie</i> at Messina.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hennepin</span> was all eagerness to join in the adventure; and, to his great
   satisfaction, La Salle gave him a letter from his Provincial, Father Le
   F&egrave;vre, containing the coveted permission. Whereupon, to prepare
   himself, he went into retreat at the R&eacute;collet convent of Quebec,
   where he remained for a time in such prayer and meditation as his nature,
   the reverse of spiritual, would permit. Frontenac, always partial to his
   Order, then invited him to dine at the ch&acirc;teau; and having visited
   the bishop and asked his blessing, he went down to the Lower Town and
   embarked. His vessel was a small birch canoe, paddled by two men. With
   sandalled feet, a coarse gray capote, and peaked hood, the cord of St.
   Francis about his waist, and a rosary and crucifix hanging at his side,
   the father set forth on his memorable journey. He <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg
   132]</a></span> carried with him the furniture of a portable altar, which
   in time of need he could strap on his back like a knapsack.</p>
<p>He slowly made his way up the St. Lawrence, stopping here and there, where
   a clearing and a few log houses marked the feeble beginning of a parish
   and a seigniory. The settlers, though good Catholics, were too few and
   too poor to support a priest, and hailed the arrival of the friar with
   delight. He said mass, exhorted a little, as was his custom, and on one
   occasion baptized a child. At length he reached Montreal, where the enemies
   of the enterprise enticed away his two canoe-men. He succeeded in finding
   two others, with whom he continued his voyage, passed the rapids of the
   upper St. Lawrence, and reached Fort Frontenac at eleven o'clock at night
   of the second of November, where his brethren of the mission, Ribourde
   and Buisset, received him with open arms.<a name="fnanchor_104" id="fnanchor_104"></a><a href="#footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> La Motte, with most of
   the men, appeared on the eighth; but La Salle and Tonty did not arrive
   till more than a month later. Meanwhile, in pursuance of his orders, fifteen
   men set out in canoes for Lake Michigan and the Illinois, to trade with
   the Indians and collect provisions, while La Motte embarked in a small
   vessel for Niagara, accompanied by Hennepin.<a name="fnanchor_105" id="fnanchor_105"></a><a href="#footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HENNEPIN</div>
<p>This bold, hardy, and adventurous friar, the historian of the expedition,
   and a conspicuous actor in it, has unwittingly painted his own portrait
   with tolerable distinctness. "I always," he says, "felt a strong inclination
   to fly from the world and live according to the rules of a pure and severe
   virtue; and it was with this view that I entered the Order of St. Francis."<a name="fnanchor_106" id="fnanchor_106"></a><a href="#footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
   He then speaks of his zeal for the saving of souls, but admits that a
   passion for travel and a burning desire to visit strange lands had no
   small part in his inclination for the missions.<a name="fnanchor_107" id="fnanchor_107"></a><a href="#footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Being in a convent
   in Artois, his Superior sent him to Calais, at the season of the herring-fishery,
   to beg alms, after the practice of the Franciscans. Here and at Dunkirk
   he made friends of the sailors, and was never tired of their stories.
   So insatiable, indeed, was his appetite for them, that "often," he says, "I
   hid myself behind tavern doors while the sailors were telling of their
   voyages. The tobacco smoke made me very sick at the stomach; but, notwithstanding,
   I listened attentively to all they said about their adventures at sea
   and their travels in distant countries. I could have passed whole days
   and nights in this way without eating."<a name="fnanchor_108" id="fnanchor_108"></a><a href="#footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>
<p>He presently set out on a roving mission through  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg
134]</a></span> Holland; and he recounts various mishaps which befell
   him, "in consequence of my zeal in laboring for the saving of souls," "I
   was at the bloody fight of Seneff," he pursues, "where so many perished
   by fire and sword, and where I had abundance of work in comforting
   and consoling the poor wounded soldiers. After undergoing great
   fatigues, and running extreme danger in the sieges of towns, in
   the trenches, and in battles, where I exposed myself freely for
   the salvation of others while the soldiers were breathing nothing
   but blood and carnage, I found myself at last in a way of satisfying
   my old inclination for travel."<a name="fnanchor_109" id="fnanchor_109"></a><a href="#footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>
<p>He got leave from his superiors to go to Canada, the most adventurous
   of all the missions, and accordingly sailed in 1675, in the ship which
   carried La Salle, who had just obtained the grant of Fort Frontenac. In
   the course of the voyage, he took it upon him to reprove a party of girls
   who were amusing themselves and a circle of officers and other passengers
   by dancing on deck. La Salle, who was among the spectators, was annoyed
   at Hennepin's interference, and told him that he was behaving like a pedagogue.
   The friar retorted, by alluding&mdash; unconsciously, as he says&mdash;to
   the circumstance that La Salle was once a pedagogue himself, having, according
   to Hennepin, been for ten or twelve years teacher of a class in a Jesuit
   school. La Salle, he adds, turned pale with rage, and never forgave him <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg
   135]</a></span> to his dying day, but always maligned and persecuted him.<a name="fnanchor_110" id="fnanchor_110"></a><a href="#footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>
<p>On arriving in Canada, he was sent up to Fort Frontenac, as a missionary.
   That wild and remote post was greatly to his liking. He planted a gigantic
   cross, superintended the building of a chapel for himself and his colleague
   Buisset, and instructed the Iroquois colonists of the place. He visited,
   too, the neighboring Indian settlements, &mdash;paddling his canoe in
   summer, when the lake was open, and journeying in winter on snow-shoes,
   with a blanket slung at his back. His most noteworthy journey was one
   which he made in the winter,&mdash;apparently of 1677,&mdash;with a soldier
   of the fort. They crossed the eastern extremity of Lake Ontario on snow-shoes,
   and pushed southward through the forests, towards Onondaga,&mdash;stopping
   at evening to dig away the snow, which was several feet deep, and collect
   wood for their fire, which they were forced to replenish repeatedly during
   the night, to keep themselves from freezing. At length, they reached the
   great Onondaga town, where the Indians were much amazed at their hardihood.
   Thence they proceeded eastward to the Oneidas, and afterwards to the Mohawks,
   who regaled them with small frogs, pounded up with a porridge of Indian
   corn. Here Hennepin found the Jesuit Bruyas, who permitted him to copy
   a dictionary  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg
   136]</a></span> of the Mohawk language<a name="fnanchor_111" id="fnanchor_111"></a><a href="#footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> which he had compiled; and
   here he presently met three Dutchmen, who urged him to visit the neighboring
   settlement of Orange, or Albany,&mdash;an invitation which he seems to
   have declined.<a name="fnanchor_112" id="fnanchor_112"></a><a href="#footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>
<p>They were pleased with him, he says, because he spoke Dutch. Bidding them
   farewell, he tied on his snow-shoes again, and returned with his companion
   to Fort Frontenac. Thus he inured himself to the hardships of the woods,
   and prepared for the execution of the grand plan of discovery which he
   calls his own,&mdash;"an enterprise," to borrow his own words, "capable
   of terrifying anybody but me."<a name="fnanchor_113" id="fnanchor_113"></a><a href="#footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> When the later editions of his book
   appeared, doubts had been expressed of his veracity. "I here protest to
   you, before God," he writes, addressing the reader, "that my narrative
   is faithful and sincere, and that you may believe everything related in
   it."<a name="fnanchor_114" id="fnanchor_114"></a><a href="#footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> And yet, as we shall see, this reverend father was the most
   impudent of liars; and the narrative of which he speaks is a rare monument
   of brazen mendacity. Hennepin, however, had seen and dared much; for <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg
   137]</a></span> among his many failings fear had no part, and where his
   vanity or his spite was not involved, he often told the truth. His books
   have their value, with all their enormous fabrications.<a name="fnanchor_115" id="fnanchor_115"></a><a href="#footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>
<p>La Motte and Hennepin, with sixteen men, went on board the little vessel
   of ten tons, which lay at Fort Frontenac. The friar's two brethren, Buisset
   and Ribourde, threw their arms about his neck as they bade him farewell;
   while his Indian proselytes, learning whither he was bound, stood with
   their hands pressed upon their mouths, in amazement at the perils which
   awaited their ghostly instructor. La Salle, with the rest of the party,
   was to follow as soon as he could finish his preparations. It was a boisterous
   and gusty day, the eighteenth of November. The sails were spread; the
   shore receded,&mdash;the stone walls of the fort, the huge cross that
   the friar had reared, the wigwams, the settlers' cabins, the group of
   staring Indians on the strand. The lake was rough; and the men, crowded
   in so small a craft, grew nervous and uneasy. They hugged the northern
   shore, to escape the fury of the wind, which blew savagely from the northeast;
   while the long gray sweep of naked forests on their right betokened that
   winter was fast closing in. On the twenty-sixth, they reached the neighborhood
   of the Indian town of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg
   138]</a></span> Taiaiagon,<a name="fnanchor_116" id="fnanchor_116"></a><a href="#footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> not far from Toronto, and ran their vessel,
   for safety, into the mouth of a river,&mdash;probably the Humber,&mdash;where
   the ice closed about her, and they were forced to cut her out with axes.
   On the fifth of December, they attempted to cross to the mouth of the
   Niagara; but darkness overtook them, and they spent a comfortless night,
   tossing on the troubled lake, five or six miles from shore. In the morning,
   they entered the mouth of the Niagara, and landed on the point at its
   eastern side, where now stand the historic ramparts of Fort Niagara. Here
   they found a small village of Senecas, attracted hither by the fisheries,
   who gazed with curious eyes at the vessel, and listened in wonder as the
   voyagers sang <i>Te Deum</i> in gratitude for their safe arrival.</p>
<div class="sidenote">NIAGARA FALLS.</div>
<p>Hennepin, with several others, now ascended the river in a canoe to the
   foot of the mountain ridge of Lewiston, which, stretching on the right
   hand and on the left, forms the acclivity of a vast plateau, rent with
   the mighty chasm, along which, from this point to the cataract, seven
   miles above, rush, with the fury of an Alpine torrent, the gathered waters
   of four inland oceans. To urge the canoe farther was impossible. He landed,
   with his companions, on the west bank, near the foot of that part of the
   ridge now called Queenstown Heights, climbed the steep ascent, and pushed
   through the wintry forest on a  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg
   139]</a></span> tour of exploration. On his left sank the cliffs, the
   furious river raging below; till at length, in primeval solitudes unprofaned
   as yet by the pettiness of man, the imperial cataract burst upon his sight.<a name="fnanchor_117" id="fnanchor_117"></a><a href="#footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>
<p>The explorers passed three miles beyond it, and encamped for the night
   on the banks of Chippewa Creek, scraping away the snow, which was a foot
   deep, in order to kindle a fire. In the morning they retraced their steps,
   startling a number of deer and wild turkeys on their way, and rejoined
   their companions at the mouth of the river.</p><p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg
   140]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">LA MOTTE AND THE SENECAS.</div>
<p>La Motte now began the building of a fortified house, some two leagues
   above the mouth of the Niagara.<a name="fnanchor_118" id="fnanchor_118"></a><a href="#footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Hot water was used to soften the
   frozen ground; but frost was not the only obstacle. The Senecas of the
   neighboring village betrayed a sullen jealousy at a design which, indeed,
   boded them no good. Niagara was the key to the four great lakes above;
   and whoever held possession of it could, in no small measure, control
   the fur-trade of the interior. Occupied by the French, it would in time
   of peace intercept the trade which the Iroquois carried on between the
   western Indians and the Dutch and English at Albany, and in time of war
   threaten them with serious danger. La Motte saw the necessity of conciliating
   these formidable neighbors, and, if possible, cajoling them to give their
   consent to the plan. La Salle, indeed, had instructed him to that effect.
   He resolved on a journey to the great village of the Senecas, and called
   on Hennepin, who was busied in building a bark chapel for himself, to
   accompany him. They accordingly set out with several men well armed and
   equipped, and bearing at their backs presents of very considerable value.
   The village was beyond the Genesee, southeast of the site of Rochester.<a name="fnanchor_119" id="fnanchor_119"></a><a href="#footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
   After a march of five days, they reached it on the last day of December.
   They were conducted <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg
   141]</a></span> to the lodge of the great chief, where they were beset
   by a staring crowd of women and children. Two Jesuits, Raffeix and Julien
   Garnier, were in the village; and their presence boded no good for the
   embassy. La Motte, who seems to have had little love for priests of any
   kind, was greatly annoyed at seeing them; and when the chiefs assembled
   to hear what he had to say, he insisted that the two fathers should leave
   the council-house. At this, Hennepin, out of respect for his cloth, thought
   it befitting that he should retire also. The chiefs, forty-two in number,
   squatted on the ground, arrayed in ceremonial robes of beaver, wolf, or
   black-squirrel skin. "The senators of Venice," writes Hennepin, "do not
   look more grave or speak more deliberately than the counsellors of the
   Iroquois." La Motte's interpreter harangued the attentive conclave, placed
   gift after gift at their feet,&mdash;coats, scarlet cloth, hatchets, knives,
   and beads,&mdash;and used all his eloquence to persuade them that the
   building of a fort on the banks of the Niagara, and a vessel on Lake Erie,
   were measures vital to their interest. They gladly took the gifts, but
   answered the interpreter's speech with evasive generalities; and having
   been entertained with the burning of an Indian prisoner, the discomfited
   embassy returned, half-famished, to Niagara.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, La Salle and Tonty were on their way from Fort Frontenac, with
   men and supplies, to join La Motte and his advance party. They were <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg
   142]</a></span> in a small vessel, with a pilot either unskilful or treacherous.
   On Christmas eve, he was near wrecking them off the Bay of Quint&eacute;.
   On the next day they crossed to the mouth of the Genesee; and La Salle,
   after some delay, proceeded to the neighboring town of the Senecas, where
   he appears to have arrived just after the departure of La Motte and Hennepin.
   He, too, called them to a council, and tried to soothe the extreme jealousy
   with which they regarded his proceedings. "I told them my plan," he says, "and
   gave the best pretexts I could, and I succeeded in my attempt."<a name="fnanchor_120" id="fnanchor_120"></a><a href="#footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> More
   fortunate than La Motte, he persuaded them to consent to his carrying
   arms and ammunition by the Niagara portage, building a vessel above the
   cataract, and establishing a fortified warehouse at the mouth of the river.</p>
<div class="sidenote">JEALOUSIES.</div>
<p>This success was followed by a calamity. La Salle had gone up the Niagara
   to find a suitable place for a ship-yard, when he learned that the pilot
   in charge of the vessel he had left had disobeyed his orders, and ended
   by wrecking it on the coast. Little was saved except the anchors and cables
   destined for the new vessel to be built above the cataract. This loss
   threw him into extreme perplexity, and, as Hennepin says, "would have
   made anybody but him give up the enterprise."<a name="fnanchor_121" id="fnanchor_121"></a><a href="#footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The whole party were
   now gathered <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg
   143]</a></span> at the palisaded house which La Motte had built, a little
   below the mountain ridge of Lewiston. They were a motley crew of French,
   Flemings, and Italians, all mutually jealous. La Salle's enemies had tampered
   with some of the men; and none of them seemed to have had much heart for
   the enterprise. The fidelity even of La Motte was doubtful. "He served
   me very ill," says La Salle; "and Messieurs de Tonty and de la Forest
   knew that he did his best to debauch all my men."<a name="fnanchor_122" id="fnanchor_122"></a><a href="#footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> His health soon
   failed under the hardships of these winter journeyings, and he returned
   to Fort Frontenac, half-blinded by an inflammation of the eyes.<a name="fnanchor_123" id="fnanchor_123"></a><a href="#footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> La
   Salle, seldom happy in the choice of subordinates, had, perhaps, in all
   his company but one man whom he could fully trust; and this was Tonty.
   He and Hennepin were on indifferent terms. Men thrown together in a rugged
   enterprise like this quickly learn to know each other; and the vain and
   assuming friar was not likely to commend himself to La Salle's brave and
   loyal lieutenant. Hennepin says that it was La Salle's policy to govern
   through the dissensions of his followers; and, from whatever cause, it
   is certain that those beneath him were rarely in perfect harmony.</p>

      his second account, on his return from the West&mdash;is very minute,
      and on the whole very accurate. He indulges in gross exaggeration as
      to the height of the cataract, which, in the edition of 1683, he states
      at five hundred feet, and raises to six hundred in that of 1697. He
      also says that there was room for four carriages to pass abreast under
      the American Fall without being wet. This is, of course, an exaggeration
      at the best; but it is extremely probable that a great change has taken
      place since his time. He speaks of a small lateral fall at the west
      side of the Horse Shoe Fall which does not now exist. Table Rock, now
      destroyed, is distinctly figured in his picture. He says that he descended
      the cliffs on the west side to the foot of the cataract, but that no
      human being can get down on the east side.</p>
   <p>The name of Niagara, written <i>Onguiaahra</i> by Lalemant in 1641,
      and <i>Ongiara</i> by Sanson, on his map of 1657, is used by Hennepin
      in its present form. His description of the falls is the earliest known
      to exist. They are clearly indicated on the map of Champlain, 1632.
      For early references to them, see "The Jesuits in North America," 235, <i>note</i>.
      A brief but curious notice of them is given by Gendron, <i>Quelques
      Particularitez du Pays des Hurons</i>, 1659. The indefatigable Dr.
      O'Callaghan has discovered thirty-nine distinct forms of the name Niagara. <i>Index

<div class="sidenote">THE NIAGARA PORTAGE.</div>
<p><span class="smcap">A more</span> important work than that of the warehouse at the mouth of the river
   was now to be begun. This was the building of a vessel above the cataract.
   The small craft which had brought La Motte and Hennepin with their advance
   party had been hauled to the foot of the rapids at Lewiston, and drawn
   ashore with a capstan, to save her from the drifting ice. Her lading was
   taken out, and must now be carried beyond the cataract to the calm water
   above. The distance to the destined point was at least twelve miles, and
   the steep heights above Lewiston must first be climbed. This heavy task
   was accomplished on the twenty-second of January. The level of the plateau
   was reached, and the file of burdened men, some thirty in number, toiled
   slowly on its way over the snowy plains and through the gloomy forests
   of spruce and naked oak-trees; while Hennepin plodded through the drifts
   with his portable altar <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg
   145]</a></span> lashed fast to his back. They came at last to the mouth
   of a stream which entered the Niagara two leagues above the cataract,
   and which was undoubtedly that now called Cayuga Creek.<a name="fnanchor_124" id="fnanchor_124"></a><a href="#footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg
   146]</a></span></p>
<p>Trees were felled, the place cleared, and the master-carpenter set his
   ship-builders at work. Meanwhile, two Mohegan hunters, attached to the
   party, made bark wigwams to lodge the men. Hennepin had his chapel, apparently
   of the same material, where he placed his altar, and on Sundays and saints'
   days said mass, preached, and exhorted; while some of the men, who knew
   the Gregorian chant, lent their aid at the service. When the carpenters
   were ready to lay the keel of the vessel, La Salle asked the friar to
   drive the first bolt; "but the modesty of my religious profession," he
   says, "compelled me to decline this honor."</p>
<p>Fortunately, it was the hunting-season of the Iroquois, and most of the
   Seneca warriors were in the forests south of Lake Erie; yet enough remained
   to cause serious uneasiness. They loitered sullenly about the place, expressing
   their displeasure at the proceedings of the French. One of them, pretending <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg
   147]</a></span> to be drunk, attacked the blacksmith and tried to kill
   him; but the Frenchman, brandishing a red-hot bar of iron, held him at
   bay till Hennepin ran to the rescue, when, as he declares, the severity
   of his rebuke caused the savage to desist.<a name="fnanchor_125" id="fnanchor_125"></a><a href="#footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The work of the ship-builders
   advanced rapidly; and when the Indian visitors beheld the vast ribs of
   the wooden monster, their jealousy was redoubled. A squaw told the French
   that they meant to burn the vessel on the stocks. All now stood anxiously
   on the watch. Cold, hunger, and discontent found imperfect antidotes in
   Tonty's energy and Hennepin's sermons.</p>
<div class="sidenote">SUFFERING AND DISCONTENT.</div>
<p>La Salle was absent, and his lieutenant commanded in his place. Hennepin
   says that Tonty was jealous because he, the friar, kept a journal, and
   that he was forced to use all manner of just precautions to prevent the
   Italian from seizing it. The men, being half-starved, in consequence of
   the loss of their provisions on Lake Ontario, were restless and moody;
   and their discontent was fomented by one of their number, who had very
   probably been tampered with by La Salle's enemies.<a name="fnanchor_126" id="fnanchor_126"></a><a href="#footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The Senecas refused
   to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> supply
   them with corn, and the frequent exhortations of the R&eacute;collet father
   proved an insufficient substitute. In this extremity, the two Mohegans
   did excellent service,&mdash;bringing deer and other game, which relieved
   the most pressing wants of the party, and went far to restore their cheerfulness.</p>
<p>La Salle, meanwhile, had gone down to the mouth of the river, with a sergeant
   and a number of men; and here, on the high point of land where Fort Niagara
   now stands, he marked out the foundations of two blockhouses.<a name="fnanchor_127" id="fnanchor_127"></a><a href="#footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Then,
   leaving his men to build them, he set out on foot for Fort Frontenac,
   where the condition of his affairs demanded his presence, and where he
   hoped to procure supplies to replace those lost in the wreck of his vessel.
   It was February, and the distance was some two hundred and fifty miles,
   through the snow-encumbered forests of the Iroquois and over the ice of
   Lake Ontario. Two men attended him, and a dog dragged his baggage on a
   sledge. For food, they had only a bag of parched corn, which failed them
   two days before they reached the fort; and they made the rest of the journey
   fasting.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE SHIP FINISHED.</div>
<p>During his absence, Tonty finished the vessel, which was of about forty-five
   tons' burden.<a name="fnanchor_128" id="fnanchor_128"></a><a href="#footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> As <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg
   149]</a></span> spring opened, she was ready for launching. The friar
   pronounced his blessing on her; the assembled company sang <i>Te Deum</i>;
   cannon were fired; and French and Indians, warmed alike by a generous
   gift of brandy, shouted and yelped in chorus as she glided into the Niagara.
   Her builders towed her out and anchored her in the stream, safe at last
   from incendiary hands; and then, swinging their hammocks under her deck,
   slept in peace, beyond reach of the tomahawk. The Indians gazed on her
   with amazement. Five small cannon looked out from her portholes; and on
   her prow was carved a portentous monster, the Griffin, whose name she
   bore, in honor of the armorial bearings of Frontenac. La Salle had often
   been heard to say that he would make the griffin fly above the crows,
   or, in other words, make Frontenac triumph over the Jesuits.</p>
<p>They now took her up the river, and made her fast below the swift current
   at Black Rock. Here they finished her equipment, and waited for La Salle's
   return; but the absent commander did not appear. The spring and more than
   half of the summer had passed before they saw him again. At length, early
   in August, he arrived at the mouth of the Niagara, bringing three more
   friars; for, though no friend of the Jesuits, he was zealous for the Faith,
   and was rarely without a missionary in his journeyings. Like Hennepin,
   the three friars were all Flemings. One <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg
   150]</a></span> of them, Melithon Watteau, was to remain at Niagara; the
   others, Zenobe Membr&eacute; and Gabriel Ribourde, were to preach the
   Faith among the tribes of the West. Ribourde was a hale and cheerful old
   man of sixty-four. He went four times up and down the Lewiston heights,
   while the men were climbing the steep pathway with their loads. It required
   four of them, well stimulated with brandy, to carry up the principal anchor
   destined for the "Griffin."</p>
<p>La Salle brought a tale of disaster. His enemies, bent on ruining the
   enterprise, had given out that he was embarked on a harebrained venture,
   from which he would never return. His creditors, excited by rumors set
   afloat to that end, had seized on all his property in the settled parts
   of Canada, though his seigniory of Fort Frontenac alone would have more
   than sufficed to pay all his debts. There was no remedy. To defer the
   enterprise would have been to give his adversaries the triumph that they
   sought; and he hardened himself against the blow with his usual stoicism.<a name="fnanchor_129" id="fnanchor_129"></a><a href="#footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>
<div class="footnotes">
   <h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_124" id="footnote_124"></a><a href="#fnanchor_124"> <span class="label">[124]</span></a> It has been a matter of debate on which side of the Niagara the
      first vessel on the Upper Lakes was built. A close study of Hennepin,
      and a careful examination of the localities, have convinced me that
      the spot was that indicated above. Hennepin repeatedly alludes to a
      large detached rock, rising out of the water at the foot of the rapids
      above Lewiston, on the west side of the river. This rock may still
      be seen immediately under the western end of the Lewiston suspension-bridge.
      Persons living in the neighborhood remember that a ferry-boat used
      to pass between it and the cliffs of the western shore; but it has
      since been undermined by the current and has inclined in that direction,
      so that a considerable part of it is submerged, while the gravel and
      earth thrown down from the cliff during the building of the bridge
      has filled the intervening channel. Opposite to this rock, and on the
      east side of the river, says Hennepin, are three mountains, about two
      leagues below the cataract. (<i>Nouveau Voyage</i> (1704), 462, 466.)
      To these "three mountains," as well as to the rock, he frequently alludes.
      They are also spoken of by La Hontan, who clearly indicates their position.
      They consist in the three successive grades of the acclivity: first,
      that which rises from the level of the water, forming the steep and
      lofty river-bank; next, an intermediate ascent, crowned by a sort of
      terrace, where the tired men could find a second resting-place and
      lay down their burdens, whence a third effort carried them with difficulty
      to the level top of the plateau. That this was the actual "portage," or
      carrying place of the travellers, is shown by Hennepin (1704), 114,
      who describes the carrying of anchors and other heavy articles up these
      heights in August, 1679. La Hontan also passed the Falls by way of
      the "three mountains" eight years later. La Hontan (1703), 106. It
      is clear, then, that the portage was on the east side, whence it would
      be safe to conclude that the vessel was built on the same side. Hennepin
      says that she was built at the mouth of a stream (<i>rivi&egrave;re</i>)
      entering the Niagara two leagues above the Falls. Excepting one or
      two small brooks, there is no stream on the west side but Chippewa
      Creek, which Hennepin had visited and correctly placed at about a league
      from the cataract. His distances on the Niagara are usually correct.
      On the east side there is a stream which perfectly answers the conditions.
      This is Cayuga Creek, two leagues above the Falls. Immediately in front
      of it is an island about a mile long, separated from the shore by a
      narrow and deep arm of the Niagara, into which Cayuga Creek discharges
      itself. The place is so obviously suited to building and launching
      a vessel, that, in the early part of this century, the government of
      the United States chose it for the construction of a schooner to carry
      supplies to the garrisons of the Upper Lakes. The neighboring village
      now bears the name of La Salle.</p>
   <p>In examining this and other localities on the Niagara, I have been
      greatly aided by my friend O. H. Marshall, Esq., of Buffalo, who is
      unrivalled in his knowledge of the history and traditions of the Niagara
      frontier.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_125" id="footnote_125"></a><a href="#fnanchor_125"> <span class="label">[125]</span></a> Hennepin (1704), 97. On a paper drawn up at the instance of the
      Intendant Duchesneau, the names of the greater number of La Salle's

         Conti. It was burned some months after, by the carelessness of the

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_129" id="footnote_129"></a><a href="#fnanchor_129"> <span class="label">[129]</span></a> La Salle's embarrassment at this time was so great that he purposed
      to send Tonty up the lakes in the "Griffin," while he went back to
      the colony to look after his affairs; but suspecting that the pilot,
      who had already wrecked one of his vessels, was in the pay of his enemies,
      he resolved at last to take charge of the expedition himself, to prevent
      a second disaster. (<i>Lettre de La Salle, 22 Ao&ucirc;t, 1682</i>;
      Margry, ii. 214.) Among the creditors who bore hard upon him were Migeon,
      Charon, Giton, and Peloquin, of Montreal, in whose name his furs at
      Fort Frontenac had been seized. The intendant also placed under seal
      all his furs at Quebec, among which is set down the not very precious
      item of two hundred and eighty-four skins of <i>enfants du diable</i>,
      or skunks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> "Griffin" had lain moored by the shore, so near that Hennepin could
   preach on Sundays from the deck to the men encamped along the bank. She
   was now forced up against the current with tow-ropes and sails, till she
   reached the calm entrance of Lake Erie. On the seventh of August, La Salle
   and his followers embarked, sang <i>Te Deum</i>, and fired their cannon.
   A fresh breeze sprang up; and with swelling canvas the "Griffin" ploughed
   the virgin waves of Lake Erie, where sail was never seen before. For three
   days they held their course over these unknown waters, and on the fourth
   turned northward into the Strait of Detroit. Here, on the right hand and
   on the left, lay verdant prairies, dotted with groves and bordered with
   lofty forests. They saw walnut, chestnut, and wild plum trees, and oaks
   festooned with grape-vines; herds of deer, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg
   152]</a></span> and flocks of swans and wild turkeys. The bulwarks of
   the "Griffin" were plentifully hung with game which the men killed on
   shore, and among the rest with a number of bears, much commended by Hennepin
   for their want of ferocity and the excellence of their flesh. "Those," he
   says, "who will one day have the happiness to possess this fertile and
   pleasant strait, will be very much obliged to those who have shown them
   the way." They crossed Lake St. Clair,<a name="fnanchor_130" id="fnanchor_130"></a><a href="#footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and still sailed northward

<p>For a time they bore on prosperously. Then the wind died to a calm, then
   freshened to a gale, then rose to a furious tempest; and the vessel tossed
   wildly among the short, steep, perilous waves of the raging lake. Even
   La Salle called on his followers to commend themselves to Heaven. All
   fell to their prayers but the godless pilot, who was loud in complaint
   against his commander for having brought him, after the honor he had won
   on the ocean, to drown at last ignominiously in fresh water. The rest
   clamored to the saints. St. Anthony of Padua was promised a chapel to
   be built in his honor, if he would but save them from their jeopardy;
   while in the same breath La Salle and the friars declared him patron of
   their great enterprise.<a name="fnanchor_131" id="fnanchor_131"></a><a href="#footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> The saint heard their prayers. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg
   153]</a></span>The obedient winds were tamed; and the "Griffin" plunged
   on her way through foaming surges that still grew calmer as she advanced.
   Now the sun shone forth on woody islands, Bois Blanc and Mackinaw and
   the distant Manitoulins,&mdash;on the forest wastes of Michigan and the
   vast blue bosom of the angry lake; and now her port was won, and she found
   her rest behind the point of St. Ignace of Michilimackinac, floating in
   that tranquil cove where crystal waters cover but cannot hide the pebbly
   depths beneath. Before her rose the house and chapel of the Jesuits, enclosed
   with palisades; on the right, the Huron village, with its bark cabins
   and its fence of tall pickets; on the left, the square compact houses
   of the French traders; and, not far off, the clustered wigwams of an Ottawa
   village.<a name="fnanchor_132" id="fnanchor_132"></a><a href="#footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Here was a centre of the Jesuit missions, and a centre of
   the Indian trade; and here, under the shadow of the cross, was much sharp
   practice in the service of Mammon. Keen traders, with or without a license,
   and lawless <i>coureurs de bois</i>, whom a few years of forest life had
   weaned from civilization, made St. Ignace their resort; and here there
   were many of them when the "Griffin" came. They and their employers hated
   and feared La Salle, who, sustained as he was by the governor, might set
   at nought the prohibition of the King, debarring him from traffic with
   these tribes. Yet, while plotting <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg
   154]</a></span> against him, they took pains to allay his distrust by
   a show of welcome.</p>
<p>The "Griffin" fired her cannon, and the Indians yelped in wonder and amazement.
   The adventurers landed in state, and marched under arms to the bark chapel
   of the Ottawa village, where they heard mass. La Salle knelt before the
   altar, in a mantle of scarlet bordered with gold. Soldiers, sailors, and
   artisans knelt around him,&mdash;black Jesuits, gray R&eacute;collets,
   swarthy <i>voyageurs</i>, and painted savages; a devout but motley concourse.</p>
<p>As they left the chapel, the Ottawa chiefs came to bid them welcome, and
   the Hurons saluted them with a volley of musketry. They saw the "Griffin" at
   her anchorage, surrounded by more than a hundred bark canoes, like a Triton
   among minnows. Yet it was with more wonder than good-will that the Indians
   of the mission gazed on the "floating fort," for so they called the vessel.
   A deep jealousy of La Salle's designs had been infused into them. His
   own followers, too, had been tampered with. In the autumn before, it may
   be remembered, he had sent fifteen men up the lakes to trade for him,
   with orders to go thence to the Illinois and make preparation against
   his coming. Early in the summer, Tonty had been despatched in a canoe
   from Niagara to look after them.<a name="fnanchor_133" id="fnanchor_133"></a><a href="#footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> It was high time. Most of the men
   had been seduced from their duty, and had disobeyed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg
   155]</a></span> their orders, squandered the goods intrusted to them,
   or used them in trading on their own account. La Salle found four of them
   at Michilimackinac. These he arrested, and sent Tonty to the Falls of
   Ste. Marie, where two others were captured, with their plunder. The rest
   were in the woods, and it was useless to pursue them.</p>
<div class="sidenote">RIVALS AND ENEMIES.</div>
<p>Anxious and troubled as to the condition of his affairs in Canada. La
   Salle had meant, after seeing his party safe at Michilimackinac, to leave
   Tonty to conduct it to the Illinois, while he himself returned to the
   colony. But Tonty was still at Ste. Marie, and he had none to trust but
   himself. Therefore, he resolved at all risks to remain with his men; "for," he
   says, "I judged my presence absolutely necessary to retain such of them
   as were left me, and prevent them from being enticed away during the winter." Moreover,
   he thought that he had detected an intrigue of his enemies to hound on
   the Iroquois against the Illinois, in order to defeat his plan by involving
   him in the war.</p>
<p>Early in September he set sail again, and passing westward into Lake Michigan,<a name="fnanchor_134" id="fnanchor_134"></a><a href="#footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
   cast anchor near one of the islands at the entrance of Green Bay. Here,
   for once, he found a friend in the person of a Pottawattamie chief, who
   had been so wrought upon <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg
   156]</a></span> by the politic kindness of Frontenac that he declared
   himself ready to die for the children of Onontio.<a name="fnanchor_135" id="fnanchor_135"></a><a href="#footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Here, too, he found
   several of his advance party, who had remained faithful and collected
   a large store of furs. It would have been better had they proved false,
   like the rest. La Salle, who asked counsel of no man, resolved, in spite
   of his followers, to send back the "Griffin" laden with these furs, and
   others collected on the way, to satisfy his creditors.<a name="fnanchor_136" id="fnanchor_136"></a><a href="#footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> It was a rash
   resolution, for it involved trusting her to the pilot, who had already
   proved either incompetent or treacherous. She fired a parting shot, and
   on the eighteenth of September set sail for Niagara, with orders to return
   to the head of Lake Michigan as soon as she had discharged her cargo.
   La Salle, with the fourteen men who remained, in four canoes deeply laden
   with a forge, tools, merchandise, and arms, put out from the island and
   resumed his voyage.</p>
<div class="sidenote">POTTAWATTAMIES.</div>
<p>The parting was not auspicious. The lake, glassy and calm in the afternoon,
   was convulsed at night with a sudden storm, when the canoes were midway
   between the island and the main shore. It was with difficulty that they
   could keep together, the men <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg
   157]</a></span> shouting to each other through the darkness. Hennepin,
   who was in the smallest canoe with a heavy load, and a carpenter for a
   companion who was awkward at the paddle, found himself in jeopardy which
   demanded all his nerve. The voyagers thought themselves happy when they
   gained at last the shelter of a little sandy cove, where they dragged
   up their canoes, and made their cheerless bivouac in the drenched and
   dripping forest. Here they spent five days, living on pumpkins and Indian
   corn, the gift of their Pottawattamie friends, and on a Canada porcupine
   brought in by La Salle's Mohegan hunter. The gale raged meanwhile with
   relentless fury. They trembled when they thought of the "Griffin." When
   at length the tempest lulled, they re-embarked, and steered southward
   along the shore of Wisconsin; but again the storm fell upon them, and
   drove them for safety to a bare, rocky islet. Here they made a fire of
   drift-wood, crouched around it, drew their blankets over their heads,
   and in this miserable plight, pelted with sleet and rain, remained for
   two days.</p>
<p>At length they were afloat again; but their prosperity was brief. On the
   twenty-eighth, a fierce squall drove them to a point of rocks covered
   with bushes, where they consumed the little that remained of their provisions.
   On the first of October they paddled about thirty miles, without food,
   when they came to a village of Pottawattamies, who ran down to the shore
   to help them to land; but La Salle, fearing <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg
   158]</a></span> that some of his men would steal the merchandise and desert
   to the Indians, insisted on going three leagues farther, to the great
   indignation of his followers. The lake, swept by an easterly gale, was
   rolling its waves against the beach, like the ocean in a storm. In the
   attempt to land, La Salle's canoe was nearly swamped. He and his three
   canoe-men leaped into the water, and in spite of the surf, which nearly
   drowned them, dragged their vessel ashore with all its load. He then went
   to the rescue of Hennepin, who with his awkward companion was in woful
   need of succor. Father Gabriel, with his sixty-four years, was no match
   for the surf and the violent undertow. Hennepin, finding himself safe,
   waded to his relief, and carried him ashore on his sturdy shoulders; while
   the old friar, though drenched to the skin, laughed gayly under his cowl
   as his brother missionary staggered with him up the beach.<a name="fnanchor_137" id="fnanchor_137"></a><a href="#footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>
<p>When all were safe ashore, La Salle, who distrusted the Indians they had
   passed, took post on a hill, and ordered his followers to prepare their
   guns for action. Nevertheless, as they were starving, an effort must be
   risked to gain a supply of food; and he sent three men back to the village
   to purchase it. Well armed, but faint with toil and famine, they made
   their way through the stormy forest bearing a pipe of peace, but on arriving
   saw that the scared inhabitants had fled. They found, however, a stock
   of corn, of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg
   159]</a></span> which they took a portion, leaving goods in exchange,
   and then set out on their return.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, about twenty of the warriors, armed with bows and arrows, approached
   the camp of the French to reconnoitre. La Salle went to meet them with
   some of his men, opened a parley with them, and kept them seated at the
   foot of the hill till his three messengers returned, when on seeing the
   peace-pipe the warriors set up a cry of joy. In the morning they brought
   more corn to the camp, with a supply of fresh venison, not a little cheering
   to the exhausted Frenchmen, who, in dread of treachery, had stood under
   arms all night.</p>
<div class="sidenote">HARDSHIPS.</div>
<p>This was no journey of pleasure. The lake was ruffled with almost ceaseless
   storms; clouds big with rain above, a turmoil of gray and gloomy waves
   beneath. Every night the canoes must be shouldered through the breakers
   and dragged up the steep banks, which, as they neared the site of Milwaukee,
   became almost insurmountable. The men paddled all day, with no other food
   than a handful of Indian corn. They were spent with toil, sick with the
   haws and wild berries which they ravenously devoured, and dejected at
   the prospect before them. Father Gabriel's good spirits began to fail.
   He fainted several times from famine and fatigue, but was revived by a
   certain "confection of Hyacinth" administered by Hennepin, who had a small
   box of this precious specific.</p>
<p>At length they descried at a distance, on the stormy shore, two or three
   eagles among a busy <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg
   160]</a></span> congregation of crows or turkey buzzards. They paddled
   in all haste to the spot. The feasters took flight; and the starved travellers
   found the mangled body of a deer, lately killed by the wolves. This good
   luck proved the inauguration of plenty. As they approached the head of
   the lake, game grew abundant; and, with the aid of the Mohegan, there
   was no lack of bear's meat and venison. They found wild grapes, too, in
   the woods, and gathered them by cutting down the trees to which the vines
   clung.</p>
<div class="sidenote">ENCOUNTER WITH INDIANS.</div>
<p>While thus employed, they were startled by a sight often so fearful in
   the waste and the wilderness,&mdash;the print of a human foot. It was
   clear that Indians were not far off. A strict watch was kept, not, as
   it proved, without cause; for that night, while the sentry thought of
   little but screening himself and his gun from the floods of rain, a party
   of Outagamies crept under the bank, where they lurked for some time before
   he discovered them. Being challenged, they came forward, professing great
   friendship, and pretending to have mistaken the French for Iroquois. In
   the morning, however, there was an outcry from La Salle's servant, who
   declared that the visitors had stolen his coat from under the inverted
   canoe where he had placed it; while some of the carpenters also complained
   of being robbed. La Salle well knew that if the theft were left unpunished,
   worse would come of it. First, he posted his men at the woody point of
   a peninsula, whose sandy neck was interposed between them and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg
   161]</a></span> the main forest. Then he went forth, pistol in hand, met
   a young Outagami, seized him, and led him prisoner to his camp. This done,
   he again set out, and soon found an Outagami chief,&mdash;for the wigwams
   were not far distant,&mdash;to whom he told what he had done, adding that
   unless the stolen goods were restored, the prisoner should be killed.
   The Indians were in perplexity, for they had cut the coat to pieces and
   divided it. In this dilemma they resolved, being strong in numbers, to
   rescue their comrade by force. Accordingly, they came down to the edge
   of the forest, or posted themselves behind fallen trees on the banks,
   while La Salle's men in their stronghold braced their nerves for the fight.
   Here three Flemish friars with their rosaries, and eleven Frenchmen with
   their guns, confronted a hundred and twenty screeching Outagamies. Hennepin,
   who had seen service, and who had always an exhortation at his tongue's
   end, busied himself to inspire the rest with a courage equal to his own.
   Neither party, however, had an appetite for the fray. A parley ensued:
   full compensation was made for the stolen goods, and the aggrieved Frenchmen
   were farther propitiated with a gift of beaver-skins.</p>
<p>Their late enemies, now become friends, spent the next day in dances,
   feasts, and speeches. They entreated La Salle not to advance farther,
   since the Illinois, through whose country he must pass, would be sure
   to kill him; for, added these friendly counsellors, they hated the French
   because they had been <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg
   162]</a></span> instigating the Iroquois to invade their country, Here
   was another subject of anxiety. La Salle was confirmed in his belief that
   his busy and unscrupulous enemies were intriguing for his destruction.</p>
<p>He pushed on, however, circling around the southern shore of Lake Michigan,
   till he reached the mouth of the St. Joseph, called by him the Miamis.
   Here Tonty was to have rejoined him with twenty men, making his way from
   Michilimackinac along the eastern shore of the lake; but the rendezvous
   was a solitude,&mdash;Tonty was nowhere to be seen. It was the first of
   November; winter was at hand, and the streams would soon be frozen. The
   men clamored to go forward, urging that they should starve if they could
   not reach the villages of the Illinois before the tribe scattered for
   the winter hunt. La Salle was inexorable. If they should all desert, he
   said, he, with his Mohegan hunter and the three friars, would still remain
   and wait for Tonty. The men grumbled, but obeyed; and, to divert their
   thoughts, he set them at building a fort of timber on a rising ground
   at the mouth of the river.</p>
<p>They had spent twenty days at this task, and their work was well advanced,
   when at length Tonty appeared. He brought with him only half of his men.
   Provisions had failed; and the rest of his party had been left thirty
   leagues behind, to sustain themselves by hunting. La Salle told him to
   return and hasten them forward. He set out with two men. A violent north
   wind arose. He tried to run <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg
   163]</a></span> his canoe ashore through the breakers. The two men could
   not manage their vessel, and he with his one hand could not help them.
   She swamped, rolling over in the surf. Guns, baggage, and provisions were
   lost; and the three voyagers returned to the Miamis, subsisting on acorns
   by the way. Happily, the men left behind, excepting two deserters, succeeded,
   a few days after, in rejoining the party.<a name="fnanchor_138" id="fnanchor_138"></a><a href="#footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">FOREBODINGS.</div>
<p>Thus was one heavy load lifted from the heart of La Salle. But where was
   the "Griffin"? Time enough, and more than enough, had passed for her voyage
   to Niagara and back again. He scanned the dreary horizon with an anxious
   eye. No returning sail gladdened the watery solitude, and a dark foreboding
   gathered on his heart. Yet further delay was impossible. He sent back
   two men to Michilimackinac to meet her, if she still existed, and pilot
   her to his new fort of the Miamis, and then prepared to ascend the river,
   whose weedy edges were already glassed with thin flakes of ice.<a name="fnanchor_139" id="fnanchor_139"></a><a href="#footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE'S ADVENTURE.</div>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the third of December the party re-embarked, thirty-three in all, in
   eight canoes,<a name="fnanchor_140" id="fnanchor_140"></a><a href="#footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and ascended the chill current of the St. Joseph, bordered
   with dreary meadows and bare gray forests. When they approached the site
   of the present village of South Bend, they looked anxiously along the
   shore on their right to find the portage or path leading to the headquarters
   of the Illinois. The Mohegan was absent, hunting; and, unaided by his
   practised eye, they passed the path without seeing it. La Salle landed
   to search the woods. Hours passed, and he did not return. Hennepin and
   Tonty grew uneasy, disembarked, bivouacked, ordered guns to be fired,
   and sent out men to scour the country. Night came, but not their lost
   leader. Muffled in their blankets and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg
   165]</a></span> powdered by the thick-falling snow-flakes, they sat ruefully
   speculating as to what had befallen him; nor was it till four o'clock
   of the next afternoon that they saw him approaching along the margin of
   the river. His face and hands were besmirched with charcoal; and he was
   further decorated with two opossums which hung from his belt, and which
   he had killed with a stick as they were swinging head downwards from the
   bough of a tree, after the fashion of that singular beast. He had missed
   his way in the forest, and had been forced to make a wide circuit around
   the edge of a swamp; while the snow, of which the air was full, added
   to his perplexities. Thus he pushed on through the rest of the day and
   the greater part of the night, till, about two o'clock in the morning,
   he reached the river again, and fired his gun as a signal to his party.
   Hearing no answering shot, he pursued his way along the bank, when he
   presently saw the gleam of a fire among the dense thickets close at hand.
   Not doubting that he had found the bivouac of his party, he hastened to
   the spot. To his surprise, no human being was to be seen. Under a tree
   beside the fire was a heap of dry grass impressed with the form of a man
   who must have fled but a moment before, for his couch was still warm.
   It was no doubt an Indian, ambushed on the bank, watching to kill some
   passing enemy. La Salle called out in several Indian languages; but there
   was dead silence all around. He then, with admirable coolness, took possession
   of the quarters he had found, shouting to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg
   166]</a></span> their invisible proprietor that he was about to sleep
   in his bed; piled a barricade of bushes around the spot, rekindled the
   dying fire, warmed his benumbed hands, stretched himself on the dried
   grass, and slept undisturbed till morning.</p>
<p>The Mohegan had rejoined the party before La Salle's return, and with
   his aid the portage was soon found. Here the party encamped. La Salle,
   who was excessively fatigued, occupied, together with Hennepin, a wigwam
   covered in the Indian manner with mats of reeds. The cold forced them
   to kindle a fire, which before daybreak set the mats in a blaze; and the
   two sleepers narrowly escaped being burned along with their hut.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE KANKAKEE.</div>
<p>In the morning, the party shouldered their canoes and baggage and began
   their march for the sources of the river Illinois, some five miles distant.
   Around them stretched a desolate plain, half-covered with snow and strewn
   with the skulls and bones of buffalo; while, on its farthest verge, they
   could see the lodges of the Miami Indians, who had made this place their
   abode. As they filed on their way, a man named Duplessis, bearing a grudge
   against La Salle, who walked just before him, raised his gun to shoot
   him through the back, but was prevented by one of his comrades. They soon
   reached a spot where the oozy, saturated soil quaked beneath their tread.
   All around were clumps of alder-bushes, tufts of rank grass, and pools
   of glistening water. In the midst a dark and lazy current, which a tall
   man might <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> bestride,
   crept twisting like a snake among the weeds and rushes. Here were the
   sources of the Kankakee, one of the heads of the Illinois.<a name="fnanchor_141" id="fnanchor_141"></a><a href="#footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> They set
   their canoes on this thread of water, embarked their baggage and themselves,
   and pushed down the sluggish streamlet, looking, at a little distance,
   like men who sailed on land. Fed by an unceasing tribute of the spongy
   soil, it quickly widened to a river; and they floated on their way through
   a voiceless, lifeless solitude of dreary oak barrens, or boundless marshes
   overgrown with reeds. At night, they built their fire on ground made firm
   by frost, and bivouacked among the rushes. A few days brought them to
   a more favored region. On the right hand and on the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg
   168]</a></span> left stretched the boundless prairie, dotted with leafless
   groves and bordered by gray wintry forests, scorched by the fires kindled
   in the dried grass by Indian hunters, and strewn with the carcasses and
   the bleached skulls of innumerable buffalo. The plains were scored with
   their pathways, and the muddy edges of the river were full of their hoof-prints.
   Yet not one was to be seen. At night, the horizon glowed with distant
   fires; and by day the savage hunters could be descried at times roaming
   on the verge of the prairie. The men, discontented and half-starved, would
   have deserted to them had they dared. La Salle's Mohegan could kill no
   game except two lean deer, with a few wild geese and swans. At length,
   in their straits, they made a happy discovery. It was a buffalo bull,
   fast mired in a slough. They killed him, lashed a cable about him, and
   then twelve men dragged out the shaggy monster, whose ponderous carcass
   demanded their utmost efforts.</p>
<p>The scene changed again as they descended. On either hand ran ranges of
   woody hills, following the course of the river; and when they mounted
   to their tops, they saw beyond them a rolling sea of dull green prairie,
   a boundless pasture of the buffalo and the deer, in our own day strangely
   transformed,&mdash;yellow in harvest-time with ripened wheat, and dotted
   with the roofs of a hardy and valiant yeomanry.<a name="fnanchor_142" id="fnanchor_142"></a><a href="#footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ILLINOIS TOWN.</div>
<p>They passed the site of the future town of Ottawa, and saw on their right
   the high plateau of Buffalo Rock, long a favorite dwelling-place of Indians.
   A league below, the river glided among islands bordered with stately woods.
   Close on their left towered a lofty cliff,<a name="fnanchor_143" id="fnanchor_143"></a><a href="#footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> crested with trees that
   overhung the rippling current; while before them spread the valley of
   the Illinois, in broad low meadows, bordered on the right by the graceful
   hills at whose foot now lies the village of Utica. A population far more
   numerous then tenanted the valley. Along the right bank of the river were
   clustered the lodges of a great Indian town. Hennepin counted four hundred
   and sixty of them.<a name="fnanchor_144" id="fnanchor_144"></a><a href="#footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> In shape, they were somewhat like the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg
   170]</a></span> arched top of a baggage-wagon. They were built of a framework
   of poles, covered with mats of rushes closely interwoven; and each contained
   three or four fires, of which the greater part served for two families.</p>
<div class="sidenote">HUNGER RELIEVED.</div>
<p>Here, then, was the town; but where were the inhabitants? All was silent
   as the desert. The lodges were empty, the fires dead, and the ashes cold.
   La Salle had expected this; for he knew that in the autumn the Illinois
   always left their towns for their winter hunting, and that the time of
   their return had not yet come. Yet he was not the less <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg
   171]</a></span> embarrassed, for he would fain have bought a supply of
   food to relieve his famished followers. Some of them, searching the deserted
   town, presently found the <i>caches</i>, or covered pits, in which the
   Indians hid their stock of corn. This was precious beyond measure in their
   eyes, and to touch it would be a deep offence. La Salle shrank from provoking
   their anger, which might prove the ruin of his plans; but his necessity
   overcame his prudence, and he took thirty <i>minots</i> of corn, hoping
   to appease the owners by presents. Thus provided, the party embarked again,
   and resumed their downward voyage.</p>
<p>On New Year's Day, 1680, they landed and heard mass. Then Hennepin wished
   a happy new year to La Salle first, and afterwards to all the men, making
   them a speech, which, as he tells us, was "most touching."<a name="fnanchor_145" id="fnanchor_145"></a><a href="#footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> He and
   his two brethren next embraced the whole company in turn, "in a manner," writes
   the father, "most tender and affectionate," exhorting them, at the same
   time, to patience, faith, and constancy. Four days after these solemnities,
   they reached the long expansion of the river then called Pimitoui, and
   now known as Peoria Lake, and leisurely made their way downward to the
   site of the city of Peoria.<a name="fnanchor_146" id="fnanchor_146"></a><a href="#footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Here, as evening drew near, they <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg
   172]</a></span> saw a faint spire of smoke curling above the gray forest,
   betokening that Indians were at hand. La Salle, as we have seen, had been
   warned that these tribes had been taught to regard him as their enemy;
   and when, in the morning, he resumed his course, he was prepared alike
   for peace or war.</p>
<p>The shores now approached each other; and the Illinois was once more a
   river, bordered on either hand with overhanging woods.<a name="fnanchor_147" id="fnanchor_147"></a><a href="#footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>
<p>At nine o'clock, doubling a point, he saw about eighty Illinois wigwams,
   on both sides of the river. He instantly ordered the eight canoes to be
   ranged in line, abreast, across the stream,&mdash;Tonty on the right,
   and he himself on the left. The men laid down their paddles and seized
   their weapons; while, in this warlike guise, the current bore them swiftly
   into the midst of the surprised and astounded savages. The camps were
   in a panic. Warriors whooped and howled; squaws and children screeched
   in chorus. Some snatched their bows and war-clubs; some ran in terror;
   and, in the midst of the hubbub, La Salle leaped ashore, followed by his
   men. None knew better how to deal with Indians; and he made no sign of
   friendship, knowing that it might be construed as a token of fear. His
   little knot of Frenchmen stood, gun in hand, passive, yet prepared for
   battle. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> The
   Indians, on their part, rallying a little from their fright, made all
   haste to proffer peace. Two of their chiefs came forward, holding out
   the calumet; while another began a loud harangue, to check the young warriors
   who were aiming their arrows from the farther bank. La Salle, responding
   to these friendly overtures, displayed another calumet; while Hennepin
   caught several scared children and soothed them with winning blandishments.<a name="fnanchor_148" id="fnanchor_148"></a><a href="#footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
   The uproar was quelled; and the strangers were presently seated in the
   midst of the camp, beset by a throng of wild and swarthy figures.</p>
<div class="sidenote">ILLINOIS HOSPITALITY.</div>
<p>Food was placed before them; and, as the Illinois code of courtesy enjoined,
   their entertainers conveyed the morsels with their own hands to the lips
   of these unenviable victims of their hospitality, while others rubbed
   their feet with bear's grease. La Salle, on his part, made them a gift
   of tobacco and hatchets; and when he had escaped from their caresses,
   rose and harangued them. He told them that he had been forced to take
   corn from their granaries, lest his men should die of hunger; but he prayed
   them not to be offended, promising full restitution or ample payment.
   He had come, he said, to protect them against their enemies, and teach
   them to pray to the true God. As for the Iroquois, they were subjects
   of the Great King, and therefore brethren of the French; yet, nevertheless,
   should they begin a war and invade the country of the Illinois, he would <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg
   174]</a></span> stand by them, give them guns, and fight in their defence,
   if they would permit him to build a fort among them for the security of
   his men. It was also, he added, his purpose to build a great wooden canoe,
   in which to descend the Mississippi to the sea, and then return, bringing
   them the goods of which they stood in need; but if they would not consent
   to his plans and sell provisions to his men, he would pass on to the Osages,
   who would then reap all the benefits of intercourse with the French, while
   they were left destitute, at the mercy of the Iroquois.<a name="fnanchor_149" id="fnanchor_149"></a><a href="#footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>
<p>This threat had its effect, for it touched their deep-rooted jealousy
   of the Osages. They were lavish of promises, and feasts and dances consumed
   the day. Yet La Salle soon learned that the intrigues of his enemies were
   still pursuing him. That evening, unknown to him, a stranger appeared
   in the Illinois camp. He was a Mascoutin chief, named Monso, attended
   by five or six Miamis, and bringing a gift of knives, hatchets, and kettles
   to the Illinois.<a name="fnanchor_150" id="fnanchor_150"></a><a href="#footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The chiefs assembled in a secret nocturnal session,
   where, smoking their pipes, they listened with open ears to the harangue
   of the envoys. Monso told them that he had come in behalf of certain Frenchmen,
   whom he named, to warn his hearers against the designs of La Salle, whom
   he denounced <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg
   175]</a></span> as a partisan and spy of the Iroquois, affirming that
   he was now on his way to stir up the tribes beyond the Mississippi to
   join in a war against the Illinois, who, thus assailed from the east and
   from the west, would be utterly destroyed. There was no hope for them,
   he added, but in checking the farther progress of La Salle, or, at least,
   retarding it, thus causing his men to desert him. Having thrown his fire-brand,
   Monso and his party left the camp in haste, dreading to be confronted
   with the object of their aspersions.<a name="fnanchor_151" id="fnanchor_151"></a><a href="#footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">FRESH INTRIGUES.</div>
<p>In the morning, La Salle saw a change in the behavior of his hosts. They
   looked on him askance, cold, sullen, and suspicious. There was one Omawha,
   a chief, whose favor he had won the day before by the politic gift of
   two hatchets and three knives, and who now came to him in secret to tell
   him what had taken place at the nocturnal council. La Salle at once saw
   in it a device of his enemies; and this belief was confirmed, when, in
   the afternoon, Nicanop&eacute;, brother of the head chief, sent to invite
   the Frenchmen to a feast. They repaired to his lodge; but before dinner
   was served,&mdash;that is to say, while the guests, white and red, were
   seated on <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> mats,
   each with his hunting-knife in his hand, and the wooden bowl before him
   which was to receive his share of the bear's or buffalo's meat, or the
   corn boiled in fat, with which he was to be regaled,&mdash;while such
   was the posture of the company, their host arose and began a long speech.
   He told the Frenchmen that he had invited them to his lodge less to refresh
   their bodies with good cheer than to cure their minds of the dangerous
   purpose which possessed them, of descending the Mississippi. Its shores,
   he said, were beset by savage tribes, against whose numbers and ferocity
   their valor would avail nothing; its waters were infested by serpents,
   alligators, and unnatural monsters; while the river itself, after raging
   among rocks and whirlpools, plunged headlong at last into a fathomless
   gulf, which would swallow them and their vessel forever.</p>
<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE AND THE INDIANS.</div>
<p>La Salle's men were for the most part raw hands, knowing nothing of the
   wilderness, and easily alarmed at its dangers; but there were two among
   them, old <i>coureurs de bois</i>, who unfortunately knew too much; for
   they understood the Indian orator, and explained his speech to the rest.
   As La Salle looked around on the circle of his followers, he read an augury
   of fresh trouble in their disturbed and rueful visages. He waited patiently,
   however, till the speaker had ended, and then answered him, through his
   interpreter, with great composure. First, he thanked him for the friendly
   warning which his affection had impelled him to utter; but, he continued, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg
   177]</a></span> the greater the danger, the greater the honor; and even
   if the danger were real, Frenchmen would never flinch from it. But were
   not the Illinois jealous? Had they not been deluded by lies? "We were
   not asleep, my brother, when Monso came to tell you, under cover of night,
   that we were spies of the Iroquois. The presents he gave you, that you
   might believe his falsehoods, are at this moment buried in the earth under
   this lodge. If he told the truth, why did he skulk away in the dark? Why
   did he not show himself by day? Do you not see that when we first came
   among you, and your camp was all in confusion, we could have killed you
   without needing help from the Iroquois? And now, while I am speaking,
   could we not put your old men to death, while your young warriors are
   all gone away to hunt? If we meant to make war on you, we should need
   no help from the Iroquois, who have so often felt the force of our arms.
   Look at what we have brought you. It is not weapons to destroy you, but
   merchandise and tools for your good. If you still harbor evil thoughts
   of us, be frank as we are, and speak them boldly. Go after this impostor
   Monso, and bring him back, that we may answer him face to face; for he
   never saw either us or the Iroquois, and what can he know of the plots
   that he pretends to reveal?"<a name="fnanchor_152" id="fnanchor_152"></a><a href="#footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Nicanop&eacute; had nothing to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg
   178]</a></span> reply, and, grunting assent in the depths of his throat,
   made a sign that the feast should proceed.</p>
<p>The French were lodged in huts, near the Indian camp; and, fearing treachery,
   La Salle placed a guard at night. On the morning after the feast, he came
   out into the frosty air and looked about him for the sentinels. Not one
   of them was to be seen. Vexed and alarmed, he entered hut after hut and
   roused his drowsy followers. Six of the number, including two of the best
   carpenters, were nowhere to be found. Discontented and mutinous from the
   first, and now terrified by the fictions of Nicanop&eacute;, they had
   deserted, preferring the hardships of the midwinter forest to the mysterious
   terrors of the Mississippi. La Salle mustered the rest before him, and
   inveighed sternly against the cowardice and baseness of those who had
   thus abandoned him, regardless of his many favors. If any here, he added,
   are afraid, let them but wait till the spring, and they shall have free
   leave to return to Canada, safely and without dishonor.<a name="fnanchor_153" id="fnanchor_153"></a><a href="#footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE AGAIN POISONED.</div>
<p>This desertion cut him to the heart. It showed him that he was leaning
   on a broken reed; and he felt that, on an enterprise full of doubt and
   peril, there were scarcely four men in his party whom he could trust.
   Nor was desertion the worst he had to fear; for here, as at Fort Frontenac,
   an attempt was made to kill him. Tonty tells us that poison was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg
   179]</a></span> placed in the pot in which their food was cooked, and
   that La Salle was saved by an antidote which some of his friends had given
   him before he left France. This, it will be remembered, was an epoch of
   poisoners. It was in the following month that the notorious La Voisin
   was burned alive, at Paris, for practices to which many of the highest
   nobility were charged with being privy, not excepting some in whose veins
   ran the blood of the gorgeous spendthrift who ruled the destinies of France.<a name="fnanchor_154" id="fnanchor_154"></a><a href="#footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>
<p>In these early French enterprises in the West, it was to the last degree
   difficult to hold men to their duty. Once fairly in the wilderness, completely
   freed from the sharp restraints of authority in which they had passed
   their lives, a spirit of lawlessness broke out among them with a violence
   proportioned to the pressure which had hitherto controlled it. Discipline
   had no resources and no guarantee; while those outlaws of the forest,
   the <i>coureurs de bois</i>, were always before their eyes, a standing
   example of unbridled license. La Salle, eminently skilful in his dealings
   with Indians, was rarely so happy with his own countrymen; and yet the
   desertions from which he was continually suffering were due far more to
   the inevitable difficulty of his position than to any want of conduct
   on his part.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_141" id="footnote_141"></a><a href="#fnanchor_141"> <span class="label">[141]</span></a> The Kankakee was called at this time the Theakiki, or Haukiki
      (Marest); a name which, as Charlevoix says, was afterwards corrupted
      by the French to Kiakiki whence, probably, its present form. In La
      Salle's time, the name "Theakiki" was given to the river Illinois through
      all its course. It was also called the Rivi&egrave;re Seignelay, the
      Rivi&egrave;re des Macopins, and the Rivi&egrave;re Divine, or Rivi&egrave;re
      de la Divine. The latter name, when Charlevoix visited the country
      in 1721, was confined to the northern branch. He gives an interesting
      and somewhat graphic account of the portage and the sources of the
      Kankakee, in his letter dated <i>De la Source du Theakiki, ce dix-sept
      Septembre</i>, 1721.</p>
   <p>Why the Illinois should ever have been called the "Divine," it is not
      easy to see. The Memoirs of St. Simon suggest an explanation. Madame
      de Frontenac and her friend Mademoiselle d'Outrelaise, he tells us,
      lived together in apartments at the Arsenal, where they held their <i>salon</i> and
      exercised a great power in society. They were called at court <i>les
      Divines</i>. (St. Simon, v. 335: Cheruel.) In compliment to Frontenac,
      the river may have been named after his wife or her friend. The suggestion
      is due to M. Margry. I have seen a map by Raudin, Frontenac's engineer,
      on which the river is called "Rivi&egrave;re de la Divine ou l'Outrelaise."</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_142" id="footnote_142"></a><a href="#fnanchor_142"> <span class="label">[142]</span></a> The change is very recent. Within the memory of men not yet old,
      wolves and deer, besides wild swans, wild turkeys, cranes, and pelicans,
      abounded in this region. In 1840, a friend of mine shot a deer from
      the window of a farmhouse, near the present town of La Salle. Running
      wolves on horseback was his favorite amusement in this part of the
      country. The buffalo long ago disappeared; but the early settlers found
      frequent remains of them. Mr. James Clark, of Utica, Ill., told me
      that he once found a large quantity of their bones and skulls in one
      place, as if a herd had perished in the snowdrifts.</p>

      in the narrative.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_144" id="footnote_144"></a><a href="#fnanchor_144"> <span class="label">[144]</span></a> <i>La Louisiane</i>, 137. Allouez (<i>Relation</i>, 1673-79)
      found three hundred and fifty-one lodges. This was in 1677. The population
      of this town, which embraced five or six distinct tribes of the Illinois,
      was continually changing. In 1675, Marquette addressed here an auditory
      composed of five hundred chiefs and old men, and fifteen hundred young
      men, besides women and children. He estimates the number of fires at
      five or six hundred. (<i>Voyages du P&egrave;re Marquette</i>, 98:
      Lenox.) Membr&eacute;, who was here in 1680, says that it then contained
      seven or eight thousand souls. (Membr&eacute; in Le Clerc, <i>Premier &Eacute;tablissement
      de la Foy</i>, ii. 173.) On the remarkable manuscript map of Franquelin,
      1684, it is set down at twelve hundred warriors, or about six thousand
      souls. This was after the destructive inroad of the Iroquois. Some
      years later, Rasle reported upwards of twenty-four hundred families.
      (<i>Lettre &agrave; son Fr&egrave;re, in Lettres &Eacute;difiantes.</i>)</p>
   <p>At times, nearly the whole Illinois population was gathered here. At
      other times, the several tribes that composed it separated, some dwelling
      apart from the rest; so that at one period the Illinois formed eleven
      villages, while at others they were gathered into two, of which this
      was much the larger. The meadows around it were extensively cultivated,
      yielding large crops, chiefly of Indian corn. The lodges were built
      along the river-bank for a distance of a mile, and sometimes far more.
      In their shape, though not in their material, they resembled those
      of the Hurons. There were no palisades or embankments.</p>
   <p>This neighborhood abounds in Indian relics. The village graveyard appears
      to have been on a rising ground, near the river immediately in front
      of the town of Utica. This is the only part of the river bottom, from
      this point to the Mississippi, not liable to inundation in the spring
      floods. It now forms part of a farm occupied by a tenant of Mr. James
      Clark. Both Mr. Clark and his tenant informed me that every year great
      quantities of human bones and teeth were turned up here by the plough.
      Many implements of stone are also found, together with beads and other
      ornaments of Indian and European fabric.</p>

of the "Griffin."&mdash;A Bold Resolution.&mdash;Another Vessel.&mdash;Hennepin
sent to the Mississippi.&mdash;Departure of La Salle.</div>
<div class="sidenote">BUILDING OF THE FORT.</div>
<p><span class="smcap">La Salle</span> now resolved to leave the Indian camp, and fortify himself for
   the winter in a strong position, where his men would be less exposed to
   dangerous influence, and where he could hold his ground against an outbreak
   of the Illinois or an Iroquois invasion. At the middle of January, a thaw
   broke up the ice which had closed the river; and he set out in a canoe,
   with Hennepin, to visit the site he had chosen for his projected fort.
   It was half a league below the camp, on a low hill or knoll, two hundred
   yards from the southern bank. On either side was a deep ravine, and in
   front a marshy tract, overflowed at high water. Thither, then, the party
   was removed. They dug a ditch behind the hill, connecting the two ravines,
   and thus completely isolating it. The hill was nearly square in form.
   An embankment of earth was thrown up on every side: its declivities <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg
   181]</a></span> were sloped steeply down to the bottom of the ravines
   and the ditch, and further guarded by <i>chevaux-de-frise</i>; while a
   palisade, twenty-five feet high, was planted around the whole. The lodgings
   of the men, built of musket-proof timber, were at two of the angles; the
   house of the friars at the third; the forge and magazine at the fourth;
   and the tents of La Salle and Tonty in the area within.</p>
<p>Hennepin laments the failure of wine, which prevented him from saying
   mass; but every morning and evening he summoned the men to his cabin to
   listen to prayers and preaching, and on Sundays and f&ecirc;te-days they
   chanted vespers. Father Zenobe usually spent the day in the Indian camp,
   striving, with very indifferent success, to win them to the Faith, and
   to overcome the disgust with which their manners and habits inspired him.</p>
<p>Such was the first civilized occupation of the region which now forms
   the State of Illinois. La Salle christened his new fort Fort Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur.
   The name tells of disaster and suffering, but does no justice to the iron-hearted
   constancy of the sufferer. Up to this time he had clung to the hope that
   his vessel, the "Griffin," might still be safe. Her safety was vital to
   his enterprise. She had on board articles of the last necessity to him,
   including the rigging and anchors of another vessel which he was to build
   at Fort Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur, in order to descend the Mississippi and sail
   thence to the West Indies. But now his last hope had well-nigh vanished.
   Past all reasonable <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg
   182]</a></span> doubt, the "Griffin" was lost; and in her loss he and
   all his plans seemed ruined alike.</p>
<p>Nothing, indeed, was ever heard of her. Indians, fur-traders, and even
   Jesuits, have been charged with contriving her destruction. Some say that
   the Ottawas boarded and burned her, after murdering those on board; others
   accuse the Pottawattamies; others affirm that her own crew scuttled and
   sunk her; others, again, that she foundered in a storm.<a name="fnanchor_155" id="fnanchor_155"></a><a href="#footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> As for La
   Salle, the belief grew in him to a settled conviction that she had been
   treacherously sunk by the pilot and the sailors to whom he had intrusted
   her; and he thought he had found evidence that the authors of the crime,
   laden with the merchandise they had taken from her, had reached the Mississippi
   and ascended it, hoping to join Du Lhut, a famous chief of <i>coureurs
   de bois</i>, and enrich themselves by traffic with the northern tribes.<a name="fnanchor_156" id="fnanchor_156"></a><a href="#footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE'S ANXIETIES.</div>
<p>But whether her lading was swallowed in the depths of the lake, or lost
   in the clutches of traitors, the evil was alike past remedy. She was gone,
   it mattered little how. The main-stay of the enterprise was broken; yet
   its inflexible chief lost neither heart nor hope. One path, beset with
   hardships and terrors, still lay open to him. He might return on foot
   to Fort Frontenac, and bring thence the needful succors.</p>
<p>La Salle felt deeply the dangers of such a step. His men were uneasy,
   discontented, and terrified by the stories with which the jealous Illinois
   still constantly filled their ears, of the whirlpools and the monsters
   of the Mississippi. He dreaded lest, in his absence, they should follow
   the example of their comrades, and desert. In the midst of his anxieties,
   a lucky accident gave him the means of disabusing them. He was hunting,
   one day, near the fort, when he met a young Illinois on his way home,
   half-starved, from a distant war excursion. He had been absent so long
   that he knew nothing of what had passed between his countrymen and the
   French. La Salle gave him a turkey he had shot, invited him to the fort,
   fed him, and made him presents. Having thus warmed his heart, he questioned
   him, with apparent carelessness, as to the countries he had visited, and
   especially as to the Mississippi,&mdash;on which the young warrior, seeing
   no reason to disguise the truth, gave him all the information he required.
   La Salle now made him the present of a hatchet, to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg
   184]</a></span> engage him to say nothing of what had passed, and, leaving
   him in excellent humor, repaired, with some of his followers, to the Illinois
   camp. Here he found the chiefs seated at a feast of bear's meat, and he
   took his place among them on a mat of rushes. After a pause, he charged
   them with having deceived him in regard to the Mississippi; adding that
   he knew the river perfectly, having been instructed concerning it by the
   Master of Life. He then described it to them with so much accuracy that
   his astonished hearers, conceiving that he owed his knowledge to "medicine," or
   sorcery, clapped their hands to their mouths in sign of wonder, and confessed
   that all they had said was but an artifice, inspired by their earnest
   desire that he should remain among them.<a name="fnanchor_157" id="fnanchor_157"></a><a href="#footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> On this, La Salle's men
   took heart again; and their courage rose still more when, soon after,
   a band of Chickasa, Arkansas, and Osage warriors, from the Mississippi,
   came to the camp on a friendly visit, and assured the French not only
   that the river was navigable to the sea, but that the tribes along its
   banks would give them a warm welcome.</p>
<div class="sidenote">ANOTHER VESSEL.</div>
<p>La Salle had now good reason to hope that his followers would neither
   mutiny nor desert in his absence. One chief purpose of his intended journey
   was to procure the anchors, cables, and rigging of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg
   185]</a></span> the vessel which he meant to build at Fort Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur,
   and he resolved to see her on the stocks before he set out. This was no
   easy matter, for the pit-sawyers had deserted. "Seeing," he writes, "that
   I should lose a year if I waited to get others from Montreal, I said one
   day, before my people, that I was so vexed to find that the absence of
   two sawyers would defeat my plans and make all my trouble useless, that
   I was resolved to try to saw the planks myself, if I could find a single
   man who would help me with a will." Hereupon, two men stepped forward
   and promised to do their best. They were tolerably successful, and, the
   rest being roused to emulation, the work went on with such vigor that
   within six weeks the hull of the vessel was half finished. She was of
   forty tons' burden, and was built with high bulwarks, to protect those
   on board from Indian arrows.</p>
<p>La Salle now bethought him that, in his absence, he might get from Hennepin
   service of more value than his sermons; and he requested him to descend
   the Illinois, and explore it to its mouth. The friar, though hardy and
   daring, would fain have excused himself, alleging a troublesome bodily
   infirmity; but his venerable colleague Ribourde, himself too old for the
   journey, urged him to go, telling him that if he died by the way, his
   apostolic labors would redound to the glory of God. Membr&eacute; had
   been living for some time in the Indian camp, and was thoroughly out of
   humor with the objects of his missionary <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg
   186]</a></span> efforts, of whose obduracy and filth he bitterly complained.
   Hennepin proposed to take his place, while he should assume the Mississippi
   adventure; but this Membr&eacute; declined, preferring to remain where
   he was. Hennepin now reluctantly accepted the proposed task. "Anybody
   but me," he says, with his usual modesty, "would have been very much frightened
   at the dangers of such a journey; and, in fact, if I had not placed all
   my trust in God, I should not have been the dupe of the Sieur de la Salle,
   who exposed my life rashly."<a name="fnanchor_158" id="fnanchor_158"></a><a href="#footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>
<p>On the last day of February, Hennepin's canoe lay at the water's edge;
   and the party gathered on the bank to bid him farewell. He had two companions,&mdash;Michel
   Accau, and a man known as the Picard du Gay,<a name="fnanchor_159" id="fnanchor_159"></a><a href="#footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> though his real name
   was Antoine Auguel. The canoe was well laden with gifts for the Indians,&mdash;tobacco,
   knives, beads, awls, and other goods, to a very considerable value, supplied
   at La Salle's cost; "and, in fact," observes Hennepin, "he is liberal
   enough towards his friends."<a name="fnanchor_160" id="fnanchor_160"></a><a href="#footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg

<div class="sidenote">DEPARTURE OF HENNEPIN.</div>
<p>The friar bade farewell to La Salle, and embraced all the rest in turn.
   Father Ribourde gave him his benediction. "Be of good courage and let
   your heart be comforted," said the excellent old missionary, as he spread
   his hands in benediction over the shaven crown of the reverend traveller.
   Du Gay and Accau plied their paddles; the canoe receded, and vanished
   at length behind the forest. We will follow Hennepin hereafter on his
   adventures, imaginary and real. Meanwhile, we will trace the footsteps
   of his chief, urging his way, in the storms of winter, through those vast
   and gloomy wilds,&mdash;those realms of famine, treachery, and death,&mdash;that
   lay betwixt him and his far-distant goal of Fort Frontenac.</p>
<p>On the first of March,<a name="fnanchor_161" id="fnanchor_161"></a><a href="#footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> before the frost was yet out of the ground,
   when the forest was still leafless, and the oozy prairies still patched
   with snow, a band of discontented men were again gathered on the shore
   for another leave-taking. Hard by, the unfinished ship lay on the stocks,
   white and fresh from the saw and axe, ceaselessly reminding them of the
   hardship and peril that was in store. Here you would have seen the calm,
   impenetrable face of La Salle, and with him the Mohegan hunter, who seems
   to have felt towards him that admiring attachment which he could always
   inspire in his Indian retainers. Besides the Mohegan, four Frenchmen were
   to accompany him,&mdash;Hunaut, La Violette, Collin, and Dautray.[<a name="fnanchor_162" id="fnanchor_162"></a><a href="#footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg
   188]</a></span> His parting with Tonty was an anxious one, for each well
   knew the risks that environed both. Embarking with his followers in two
   canoes, he made his way upward amid the drifting ice; while the faithful
   Italian, with two or three honest men and twelve or thirteen knaves, remained
   to hold Fort Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur in his absence.</p>

      is a long letter, addressed to the successor of Frontenac in the government
      of Canada. La Salle says that a young Indian belonging to him told
      him that three years before he saw a white man, answering the description
      of the pilot, a prisoner among a tribe beyond the Mississippi. He had
      been captured with four others on that river, while making his way
      with canoes, laden with goods, towards the Sioux. His companions had
      been killed. Other circumstances, which La Salle details at great length,
      convinced him that the white prisoner was no other than the pilot of
      the "Griffin." The evidence, however, is not conclusive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Salle</span> well knew what was before him, and nothing but necessity spurred
   him to this desperate journey. He says that he could trust nobody else
   to go in his stead, and that unless the articles lost in the "Griffin" were
   replaced without delay, the expedition would be retarded a full year,
   and he and his associates consumed by its expenses. "Therefore," he writes
   to one of them, "though the thaws of approaching spring greatly increased
   the difficulty of the way, interrupted as it was everywhere by marshes
   and rivers, to say nothing of the length of the journey, which is about
   five hundred leagues in a direct line, and the danger of meeting Indians
   of four or five different nations through whose country we were to pass,
   as well as an Iroquois army which we knew was coming that way; though
   we must suffer all the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg
   190]</a></span> time from hunger; sleep on the open ground, and often
   without food; watch by night and march by day, loaded with baggage, such
   as blanket, clothing, kettle, hatchet, gun, powder, lead, and skins to
   make moccasins; sometimes pushing through thickets, sometimes climbing
   rocks covered with ice and snow, sometimes wading whole days through marshes
   where the water was waist-deep or even more, at a season when the snow
   was not entirely melted,&mdash;though I knew all this, it did not prevent
   me from resolving to go on foot to Fort Frontenac, to learn for myself
   what had become of my vessel, and bring back the things we needed."<a name="fnanchor_163" id="fnanchor_163"></a><a href="#footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>
<p>The winter had been a severe one; and when, an hour after leaving the
   fort, he and his companions reached the still water of Peoria Lake, they
   found it sheeted with ice from shore to shore. They carried their canoes
   up the bank, made two rude sledges, placed the light vessels upon them,
   and dragged them to the upper end of the lake, where they encamped. In
   the morning they found the river still covered with ice, too weak to bear
   them and too strong to permit them to break a way for the canoes. They
   spent the whole day in carrying them through the woods, toiling knee-deep
   in saturated snow. Rain fell in floods, and they took shelter at night
   in a deserted Indian hut.</p>
<p>In the morning, the third of March, they dragged <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg
         191]</a></span> their canoes half a league farther; then launched
         them, and, breaking the ice with clubs and hatchets, forced their
         way slowly up the stream. Again their progress was barred, and again
         they took to the woods, toiling onward till a tempest of moist,
         half-liquid snow forced them to bivouac for the night. A sharp frost
         followed, and in the morning the white waste around them was glazed
         with a dazzling crust. Now, for the first time, they could use their
         snow-shoes. Bending to their work, dragging their canoes, which
         glided smoothly over the polished surface, they journeyed on hour
         after hour and league after league, till they reached at length
         the great town of the Illinois, still void of its inhabitants.<a name="fnanchor_164" id="fnanchor_164"></a><a href="#footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">THE DESERTED TOWN.</div>
<p>It was a desolate and lonely scene,&mdash;the river gliding dark and cold
   between its banks of rushes; the empty lodges, covered with crusted snow;
   the vast white meadows; the distant cliffs, bearded with shining icicles;
   and the hills wrapped in forests, which glittered from afar with the icy
   incrustations that cased each frozen twig. Yet there was life in the savage
   landscape. The men saw buffalo wading in the snow, and they killed one
   of them. More than this: they discovered the tracks of moccasins. They
   cut rushes by the edge of the river, piled them on the bank, and set them
   on fire, that the smoke might attract the eyes of savages roaming near.</p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg
   192]</a></span></p>
<p>On the following day, while the hunters were smoking the meat of the buffalo,
   La Salle went out to reconnoitre, and presently met three Indians, one
   of whom proved to be Chassagoac, the principal chief of the Illinois.<a name="fnanchor_165" id="fnanchor_165"></a><a href="#footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
   La Salle brought them to his bivouac, feasted them, gave them a red blanket,
   a kettle, and some knives and hatchets, made friends with them, promised
   to restrain the Iroquois from attacking them, told them that he was on
   his way to the settlements to bring arms and ammunition to defend them
   against their enemies, and, as the result of these advances, gained from
   the chief a promise that he would send provisions to Tonty's party at
   Fort Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur.</p>
<p>After several days spent at the deserted town, La Salle prepared to resume
   his journey. Before his departure, his attention was attracted to the
   remarkable cliff of yellow sandstone, now called Starved Rock, a mile
   or more above the village,&mdash;a natural fortress, which a score of
   resolute white men might make good against a host of savages; and he soon
   afterwards sent Tonty an order to examine it, and make it his stronghold
   in case of need.<a name="fnanchor_166" id="fnanchor_166"></a><a href="#footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>
<p>On the fifteenth the party set out again, carried <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg
         193]</a></span> their canoes along the bank of the river as far
         as the rapids above Ottawa, then launched them and pushed their
         way upward, battling with the floating ice, which, loosened by a
         warm rain, drove down the swollen current in sheets. On the eighteenth
         they reached a point some miles below the site of Joliet, and here
         found the river once more completely closed. Despairing of farther
         progress by water, they hid their canoes on an island, and struck
         across the country for Lake Michigan.</p>
<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE'S JOURNEY.</div>
<p>It was the worst of all seasons for such a journey. The nights were cold,
   but the sun was warm at noon, and the half-thawed prairie was one vast
   tract of mud, water, and discolored, half-liquid snow. On the twenty-second
   they crossed marshes and inundated meadows, wading to the knee, till at
   noon they were stopped by a river, perhaps the Calumet. They made a raft
   of hard-wood timber, for there was no other, and shoved themselves across.
   On the next day they could see Lake Michigan dimly glimmering beyond the
   waste of woods; and, after crossing three swollen streams, they reached
   it at evening. On the twenty-fourth they followed its shore, till, at
   nightfall, they arrived at the fort which they had built in the autumn
   at the mouth of the St. Joseph. Here La Salle found Chapelle and Leblanc,
   the two men whom he had sent from hence to Michilimackinac, in search
   of the "Griffin."<a name="fnanchor_167" id="fnanchor_167"></a><a href="#footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> They reported that they had made the circuit of
   the lake, and had neither <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg
   194]</a></span> seen her nor heard tidings of her. Assured of her fate,
   he ordered them to rejoin Tonty at Fort Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur; while he
   pushed onward with his party through the unknown wild of Southern Michigan.</p>
<p>"The rain," says La Salle, "which lasted all day, and the raft we were
   obliged to make to cross the river, stopped us till noon of the twenty-fifth,
   when we continued our march through the woods, which was so interlaced
   with thorns and brambles that in two days and a half our clothes were
   all torn, and our faces so covered with blood that we hardly knew each
   other. On the twenty-eighth we found the woods more open, and began to
   fare better, meeting a good deal of game, which after this rarely failed
   us; so that we no longer carried provisions with us, but made a meal of
   roast meat wherever we happened to kill a deer, bear, or turkey. These
   are the choicest feasts on a journey like this; and till now we had generally
   gone without them, so that we had often walked all day without breakfast.</p>
<div class="sidenote">INDIAN ALARMS.</div>
<p>"The Indians do not hunt in this region, which is debatable ground between
   five or six nations who are at war, and, being afraid of each other, do
   not venture into these parts except to surprise each other, and always
   with the greatest precaution and all possible secrecy. The reports of
   our guns and the carcasses of the animals we killed soon led some of them
   to find our trail. In fact, on the evening of the twenty-eighth, having
   made our fire by the edge of a prairie, we were surrounded by them; but
   as the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> man
   on guard waked us, and we posted ourselves behind trees with our guns,
   these savages, who are called Wapoos, took us for Iroquois, and thinking
   that there must be a great many of us because we did not travel secretly,
   as they do when in small bands, they ran off without shooting their arrows,
   and gave the alarm to their comrades, so that we were two days without
   meeting anybody."</p>
<p>La Salle guessed the cause of their fright; and, in order to confirm their
   delusion, he drew with charcoal, on the trunks of trees from which he
   had stripped the bark, the usual marks of an Iroquois war-party, with
   signs for prisoners and for scalps, after the custom of those dreaded
   warriors. This ingenious artifice, as will soon appear, was near proving
   the destruction of the whole party. He also set fire to the dry grass
   of the prairies over which he and his men had just passed, thus destroying
   the traces of their passage. "We practised this device every night, and
   it answered very well so long as we were passing over an open country;
   but on the thirtieth we got into great marshes, flooded by the thaws,
   and were obliged to cross them in mud or water up to the waist; so that
   our tracks betrayed us to a band of Mascoutins who were out after Iroquois.
   They followed us through these marshes during the three days we were crossing
   them; but we made no fire at night, contenting ourselves with taking off
   our wet clothes and wrapping ourselves in our blankets on some dry knoll,
   where we slept till morning. At <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg
   196]</a></span> last, on the night of the second of April, there came
   a hard frost, and our clothes, which were drenched when we took them off,
   froze stiff as sticks, so that we could not put them on in the morning
   without making a fire to thaw them. The fire betrayed us to the Indians,
   who were encamped across the marsh; and they ran towards us with loud
   cries, till they were stopped halfway by a stream so deep that they could
   not get over, the ice which had formed in the night not being strong enough
   to bear them. We went to meet them, within gun-shot; and whether our fire-arms
   frightened them, or whether they thought us more numerous than we were,
   or whether they really meant us no harm, they called out, in the Illinois
   language, that they had taken us for Iroquois, but now saw that we were
   friends and brothers; whereupon, they went off as they came, and we kept
   on our way till the fourth, when two of my men fell ill and could not
   walk."</p>
<p>In this emergency, La Salle went in search of some watercourse by which
   they might reach Lake Erie, and soon came upon a small river, which was
   probably the Huron. Here, while the sick men rested, their companions
   made a canoe. There were no birch-trees; and they were forced to use elm-bark,
   which at that early season would not slip freely from the wood until they
   loosened it with hot water. Their canoe being made, they embarked in it,
   and for a time floated prosperously down the stream, when at length the
   way was barred by a matted <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg
   197]</a></span> barricade of trees fallen across the water. The sick men
   could now walk again, and, pushing eastward through the forest, the party
   soon reached the banks of the Detroit.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE JOURNEY'S END.</div>
<p>La Salle directed two of the men to make a canoe, and go to Michilimackinac,
   the nearest harborage. With the remaining two, he crossed the Detroit
   on a raft, and, striking a direct line across the country, reached Lake
   Erie not far from Point Pel&eacute;e. Snow, sleet, and rain pelted them
   with little intermission: and when, after a walk of about thirty miles,
   they gained the lake, the Mohegan and one of the Frenchmen were attacked
   with fever and spitting of blood. Only one man now remained in health.
   With his aid, La Salle made another canoe, and, embarking the invalids,
   pushed for Niagara. It was Easter Monday when they landed at a cabin of
   logs above the cataract, probably on the spot where the "Griffin" was
   built. Here several of La Salle's men had been left the year before, and
   here they still remained. They told him woful news. Not only had he lost
   the "Griffin," and her lading of ten thousand crowns in value, but a ship
   from France, freighted with his goods, valued at more than twenty-two
   thousand livres, had been totally wrecked at the mouth of the St. Lawrence;
   and of twenty hired men on their way from Europe to join him, some had
   been detained by his enemy, the Intendant Duchesneau, while all but four
   of the remainder, being told that he was dead, had found means to return
   home.</p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>
<p>His three followers were all unfit for travel: he alone retained his strength
   and spirit. Taking with him three fresh men at Niagara, he resumed his
   journey, and on the sixth of May descried, looming through floods of rain,
   the familiar shores of his seigniory and the bastioned walls of Fort Frontenac.
   During sixty-five days he had toiled almost incessantly, travelling, by
   the course he took, about a thousand miles through a country beset with
   every form of peril and obstruction,&mdash;"the most arduous journey," says
   the chronicler, "ever made by Frenchmen in America."</p>
<p>Such was Cavelier de la Salle. In him, an unconquerable mind held at its
   service a frame of iron, and tasked it to the utmost of its endurance.
   The pioneer of western pioneers was no rude son of toil, but a man of
   thought, trained amid arts and letters.<a name="fnanchor_168" id="fnanchor_168"></a><a href="#footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> He had reached his goal;
   but for him there was neither rest nor peace. Man and Nature seemed in
   arms against him. His agents had plundered him; his creditors had seized
   his property; and several of his canoes, richly laden, had been lost in
   the rapids of the St. Lawrence.<a name="fnanchor_169" id="fnanchor_169"></a><a href="#footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> He hastened to Montreal, where <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg
   199]</a></span> his sudden advent caused great astonishment; and where,
   despite his crippled resources and damaged credit, he succeeded, within
   a week, in gaining the supplies which he required and the needful succors
   for the forlorn band on the Illinois. He had returned to Fort Frontenac,
   and was on the point of embarking for their relief, when a blow fell upon
   him more disheartening than any that had preceded.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE MUTINEERS.</div>
<p>On the twenty-second of July, two <i>voyageurs</i>, Messier and Laurent,
   came to him with a letter from Tonty, who wrote that soon after La Salle's
   departure nearly all the men had deserted, after destroying Fort Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur,
   plundering the magazine, and throwing into the river all the arms, goods,
   and stores which they could not carry off. The messengers who brought
   this letter were speedily followed by two of the <i>habitants</i> of Fort
   Frontenac, who had been trading on the lakes, and who, with a fidelity
   which the unhappy La Salle rarely knew how to inspire, had travelled day
   and night to bring him their tidings. They reported that they had met
   the deserters, and that, having been reinforced by recruits gained at
   Michilimackinac and Niagara, they now numbered twenty men.<a name="fnanchor_170" id="fnanchor_170"></a><a href="#footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> They had
   destroyed the fort on the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg
   200]</a></span> St. Joseph, seized a quantity of furs belonging to La
   Salle at Michilimackinac, and plundered the magazine at Niagara. Here
   they had separated, eight of them coasting the south side of Lake Ontario
   to find harborage at Albany, a common refuge at that time of this class
   of scoundrels; while the remaining twelve, in three canoes, made for Fort
   Frontenac along the north shore, intending to kill La Salle as the surest
   means of escaping punishment.</p>
<div class="sidenote">CHASTISEMENT.</div>
<p>He lost no time in lamentation. Of the few men at his command he chose
   nine of the trustiest, embarked with them in canoes, and went to meet
   the marauders. After passing the Bay of Quint&eacute;, he took his station
   with five of his party at a point of land suited to his purpose, and detached
   the remaining four to keep watch. In the morning, two canoes were discovered
   approaching without suspicion, one of them far in advance of the other.
   As the foremost drew near, La Salle's canoe darted out from under the
   leafy shore,&mdash;two of the men handling the paddles, while he, with
   the remaining two, levelled their guns at the deserters, and called on
   them to surrender. Astonished and dismayed, they yielded at once; while
   two more, who were in the second canoe, hastened to follow their example.
   La Salle now returned to the fort with his prisoners, placed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg
   201]</a></span> them in custody, and again set forth. He met the third
   canoe upon the lake at about six o'clock in the evening. His men vainly
   plied their paddles in pursuit. The mutineers reached the shore, took
   post among rocks and trees, levelled their guns, and showed fight. Four
   of La Salle's men made a circuit to gain their rear and dislodge them,
   on which they stole back to their canoe and tried to escape in the darkness.
   They were pursued, and summoned to yield; but they replied by aiming their
   guns at their pursuers, who instantly gave them a volley, killed two of
   them, and captured the remaining three. Like their companions, they were
   placed in custody at the fort, to await the arrival of Count Frontenac.<a name="fnanchor_171" id="fnanchor_171"></a><a href="#footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

      the best of the men who had accompanied him from the Illinois, to return
      thither as soon as he was able. Four men from Niagara were to go with
      him and he was to rejoin Tonty with such supplies as that post could
      furnish. Dautray set out accordingly, but was met on the lakes by the
      deserters, who told him that Tonty was dead, and seduced his men. (<i>Relation
      des D&eacute;couvertes.</i>) Dautray himself seems to have remained
      true; at least, he was in La Salle's service immediately after, and
      was one of his most trusted followers. He was of good birth, being
      the son of Jean Bourdon, a conspicuous personage in the early period
      of the colony; and his name appears on official records as Jean Bourdon,
      Sieur d'Autray.</p>

      official narrative called <i>Relation des D&eacute;couvertes</i>. Hennepin,
      Membr&eacute;, and Tonty also speak of the journey from Fort Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur.

<div class="sidenote">ANOTHER EFFORT.</div>
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now La Salle's work must be begun afresh. He had staked all, and all
   had seemingly been lost. In stern, relentless effort he had touched the
   limits of human endurance; and the harvest of his toil was disappointment,
   disaster, and impending ruin. The shattered fabric of his enterprise was
   prostrate in the dust. His friends desponded; his foes were blatant and
   exultant. Did he bend before the storm? No human eye could pierce the
   depths of his reserved and haughty nature; but the surface was calm, and
   no sign betrayed a shaken resolve or an altered purpose. Where weaker
   men would have abandoned all in despairing apathy, he turned anew to his
   work with the same vigor and the same apparent confidence as if borne
   on the full tide of success.</p>
<p>His best hope was in Tonty. Could that brave and true-hearted officer
   and the three or four faithful <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg
   203]</a></span> men who had remained with him make good their foothold
   on the Illinois, and save from destruction the vessel on the stocks and
   the forge and tools so laboriously carried thither, then a basis was left
   on which the ruined enterprise might be built up once more. There was
   no time to lose. Tonty must be succored soon, or succor would come too
   late. La Salle had already provided the necessary material, and a few
   days sufficed to complete his preparations. On the tenth of August he
   embarked again for the Illinois. With him went his lieutenant La Forest,
   who held of him in fief an island, then called Belle Isle, opposite Fort
   Frontenac.<a name="fnanchor_172" id="fnanchor_172"></a><a href="#footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> A surgeon, ship-carpenters, joiners, masons, soldiers, <i>voyageurs</i> and
   laborers completed his company, twenty-five men in all, with everything
   needful for the outfit of the vessel.</p>
<p>His route, though difficult, was not so long as that which he had followed
   the year before. He ascended the river Humber; crossed to Lake Simcoe,
   and thence descended the Severn to the Georgian Bay of Lake Huron; followed
   its eastern shore, coasted the Manitoulin Islands, and at length reached
   Michilimackinac. Here, as usual, all was hostile; and he had great difficulty
   in inducing the Indians, who had been excited against him, to sell him
   provisions. Anxious to reach his destination, he pushed forward with twelve
   men, leaving La Forest to bring on the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg
   204]</a></span> rest. On the fourth of November<a name="fnanchor_173" id="fnanchor_173"></a><a href="#footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> he reached the ruined
   fort at the mouth of the St. Joseph, and left five of his party, with
   the heavy stores, to wait till La Forest should come up, while he himself
   hastened forward with six Frenchmen and an Indian. A deep anxiety possessed
   him. The rumor, current for months past, that the Iroquois, bent on destroying
   the Illinois, were on the point of invading their country had constantly
   gained strength. Here was a new disaster, which, if realized, might involve
   him and his enterprise in irretrievable wreck.</p>
<p>He ascended the St. Joseph, crossed the portage to the Kankakee, and followed
   its course downward till it joined the northern branch of the Illinois.
   He had heard nothing of Tonty on the way, and neither here nor elsewhere
   could he discover the smallest sign of the passage of white men. His friend,
   therefore, if alive, was probably still at his post; and he pursued his
   course with a mind lightened, in some small measure, of its load of anxiety.</p>
<div class="sidenote">BUFFALO.</div>
<p>When last he had passed here, all was solitude; but now the scene was
   changed. The boundless waste was thronged with life. He beheld that wondrous
   spectacle, still to be seen at times on the plains of the remotest West,
   and the memory of which can quicken the pulse and stir the blood after <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg
   205]</a></span> the lapse of years: far and near, the prairie was alive
   with buffalo; now like black specks dotting the distant swells; now trampling
   by in ponderous columns, or filing in long lines, morning, noon, and night,
   to drink at the river,&mdash;wading, plunging, and snorting in the water;
   climbing the muddy shores, and staring with wild eyes at the passing canoes.
   It was an opportunity not to be lost. The party landed, and encamped for
   a hunt. Sometimes they hid under the shelving bank, and shot them as they
   came to drink; sometimes, flat on their faces, they dragged themselves
   through the long dead grass, till the savage bulls, guardians of the herd,
   ceased their grazing, raised their huge heads, and glared through tangled
   hair at the dangerous intruders. The hunt was successful. In three days
   the hunters killed twelve buffalo, besides deer, geese, and swans. They
   cut the meat into thin flakes, and dried it in the sun or in the smoke
   of their fires. The men were in high spirits,&mdash;delighting in the
   sport, and rejoicing in the prospect of relieving Tonty and his hungry
   followers with a plentiful supply.</p>
<p>They embarked again, and soon approached the great town of the Illinois.
   The buffalo were far behind; and once more the canoes glided on their
   way through a voiceless solitude. No hunters were seen; no saluting whoop
   greeted their ears. They passed the cliff afterwards called the Rock of
   St. Louis, where La Salle had ordered Tonty to build his stronghold; but
   as he scanned its lofty top he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg
   206]</a></span> saw no palisades, no cabins, no sign of human hand, and
   still its primeval crest of forests overhung the gliding river. Now the
   meadow opened before them where the great town had stood. They gazed,
   astonished and confounded: all was desolation. The town had vanished,
   and the meadow was black with fire. They plied their paddles, hastened
   to the spot, landed; and as they looked around their cheeks grew white,
   and the blood was frozen in their veins.</p>
<div class="sidenote">A NIGHT OF HORROR.</div>
<p>Before them lay a plain once swarming with wild human life and covered
   with Indian dwellings, now a waste of devastation and death, strewn with
   heaps of ashes, and bristling with the charred poles and stakes which
   had formed the framework of the lodges. At the points of most of them
   were stuck human skulls, half picked by birds of prey.<a name="fnanchor_174" id="fnanchor_174"></a><a href="#footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Near at hand
   was the burial-ground of the village. The travellers sickened with horror
   as they entered its revolting precincts. Wolves in multitudes fled at
   their approach; while clouds of crows or buzzards, rising from the hideous
   repast, wheeled above their heads, or settled on the naked branches of
   the neighboring forest. Every grave had been rifled, and the bodies flung
   down from the scaffolds where, after the Illinois custom, many of them
   had been placed. The field was strewn with broken bones and torn and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg
   207]</a></span> mangled corpses. A hyena warfare had been waged against
   the dead. La Salle knew the handiwork of the Iroquois. The threatened
   blow had fallen, and the wolfish hordes of the five cantons had fleshed
   their rabid fangs in a new victim.<a name="fnanchor_175" id="fnanchor_175"></a><a href="#footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>
<p>Not far distant, the conquerors had made a rude fort of trunks, boughs,
   and roots of trees laid together to form a circular enclosure; and this,
   too, was garnished with skulls, stuck on the broken branches and protruding
   sticks. The <i>caches</i>, or subterranean store-houses of the villagers,
   had been broken open and the contents scattered. The cornfields were laid
   waste, and much of the corn thrown into heaps and half burned. As La Salle
   surveyed this scene of havoc, one thought engrossed him: where were Tonty
   and his men? He searched the Iroquois fort: there were abundant traces
   of its savage occupants, and, among them, a few fragments of French clothing. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg
   208]</a></span> He examined the skulls; but the hair, portions of which
   clung to nearly all of them, was in every case that of an Indian. Evening
   came on before he had finished the search. The sun set, and the wilderness
   sank to its savage rest. Night and silence brooded over the waste, where,
   far as the raven could wing his flight, stretched the dark domain of solitude
   and horror.</p>
<p>Yet there was no silence at the spot where La Salle and his companions
   made their bivouac. The howling of the wolves filled the air with fierce
   and dreary dissonance. More dangerous foes were not far off, for before
   nightfall they had seen fresh Indian tracks; "but, as it was very cold," says
   La Salle, "this did not prevent us from making a fire and lying down by
   it, each of us keeping watch in turn. I spent the night in a distress
   which you can imagine better than I can write it; and I did not sleep
   a moment with trying to make up my mind as to what I ought to do. My ignorance
   as to the position of those I was looking after, and my uncertainty as
   to what would become of the men who were to follow me with La Forest if
   they arrived at the ruined village and did not find me there, made me
   apprehend every sort of trouble and disaster. At last, I decided to keep
   on my way down the river, leaving some of my men behind in charge of the
   goods, which it was not only useless but dangerous to carry with me, because
   we should be forced to abandon them when the winter fairly set in, which
   would be very soon."</p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg
   209]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">FEARS FOR TONTY.</div>
<p>This resolution was due to a discovery he had made the evening before,
   which offered, as he thought, a possible clew to the fate of Tonty and
   the men with him. He thus describes it: "Near the garden of the Indians,
   which was on the meadows, a league from the village and not far from the
   river, I found six pointed stakes set in the ground and painted red. On
   each of them was the figure of a man with bandaged eyes, drawn in black.
   As the savages often set stakes of this sort where they have killed people,
   I thought, by their number and position, that when the Iroquois came,
   the Illinois, finding our men alone in the hut near their garden, had
   either killed them or made them prisoners. And I was confirmed in this,
   because, seeing no signs of a battle, I supposed that on hearing of the
   approach of the Iroquois, the old men and other non-combatants had fled,
   and that the young warriors had remained behind to cover their flight,
   and afterwards followed, taking the French with them; while the Iroquois,
   finding nobody to kill, had vented their fury on the corpses in the graveyard."</p>
<p>Uncertain as was the basis of this conjecture, and feeble as was the hope
   it afforded, it determined him to push forward, in order to learn more.
   When daylight returned, he told his purpose to his followers, and directed
   three of them to await his return near the ruined village. They were to
   hide themselves on an island, conceal their fire at night, make no smoke
   by day, fire no guns, and keep a close <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg
   210]</a></span> watch. Should the rest of the party arrive, they, too,
   were to wait with similar precautions. The baggage was placed in a hollow
   of the rocks, at a place difficult of access; and, these arrangements
   made, La Salle set out on his perilous journey with the four remaining
   men, Dautray, Hunaut, You, and the Indian. Each was armed with two guns,
   a pistol, and a sword; and a number of hatchets and other goods were placed
   in the canoe, as presents for Indians whom they might meet.</p>
<p>Several leagues below the village they found, on their right hand close
   to the river, a sort of island, made inaccessible by the marshes and water
   which surrounded it. Here the flying Illinois had sought refuge with their
   women and children, and the place was full of their deserted huts. On
   the left bank, exactly opposite, was an abandoned camp of the Iroquois.
   On the level meadow stood a hundred and thirteen huts, and on the forest
   trees which covered the hills behind were carved the totems, or insignia,
   of the chiefs, together with marks to show the number of followers which
   each had led to the war. La Salle counted five hundred and eighty-two
   warriors. He found marks, too, for the Illinois killed or captured, but
   none to indicate that any of the Frenchmen had shared their fate.</p>
<div class="sidenote">SEARCH FOR TONTY.</div>
<p>As they descended the river, they passed, on the same day, six abandoned
   camps of the Illinois; and opposite to each was a camp of the invaders.
   The former, it was clear, had retreated in a body; while <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg
   211]</a></span> the Iroquois had followed their march, day by day, along
   the other bank. La Salle and his men pushed rapidly onward, passed Peoria
   Lake, and soon reached Fort Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur, which they found, as
   they expected, demolished by the deserters. The vessel on the stocks was
   still left entire, though the Iroquois had found means to draw out the
   iron nails and spikes. On one of the planks were written the words: "<i>Nous
   sommes tous sauvages: ce 15, 1680</i>,"&mdash;the work, no doubt, of the
   knaves who had pillaged and destroyed the fort.</p>
<p>La Salle and his companions hastened on, and during the following day
   passed four opposing camps of the savage armies. The silence of death
   now reigned along the deserted river, whose lonely borders, wrapped deep
   in forests, seemed lifeless as the grave. As they drew near the mouth
   of the stream they saw a meadow on their right, and on its farthest verge
   several human figures, erect, yet motionless. They landed, and cautiously
   examined the place. The long grass was trampled down, and all around were
   strewn the relics of the hideous orgies which formed the ordinary sequel
   of an Iroquois victory. The figures they had seen were the half-consumed
   bodies of women, still bound to the stakes where they had been tortured.
   Other sights there were, too revolting for record.<a name="fnanchor_176" id="fnanchor_176"></a><a href="#footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> All the remains
   were those <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> of
   women and children. The men, it seemed, had fled, and left them to their
   fate.</p>
<p>Here, again, La Salle sought long and anxiously, without finding the smallest
   sign that could indicate the presence of Frenchmen. Once more descending
   the river, they soon reached its mouth. Before them, a broad eddying current
   rolled swiftly on its way; and La Salle beheld the Mississippi,&mdash;the
   object of his day-dreams, the destined avenue of his ambition and his
   hopes. It was no time for reflections. The moment was too engrossing,
   too heavily charged with anxieties and cares. From a rock on the shore,
   he saw a tree stretched forward above the stream; and stripping off its
   bark to make it more conspicuous, he hung upon it a board on which he
   had drawn the figures of himself and his men, seated in their canoe, and
   bearing a pipe of peace. To this he tied a letter for Tonty, informing
   him that he had returned up the river to the ruined village.</p>
<p>His four men had behaved admirably throughout, and they now offered to
   continue the journey if he saw fit, and follow him to the sea; but he
   thought it useless to go farther, and was unwilling to abandon the three
   men whom he had ordered to await his return. Accordingly, they retraced
   their course, and, paddling at times both day and night, urged their canoe
   so swiftly that they reached the village in the incredibly short space
   of four days.<a name="fnanchor_177" id="fnanchor_177"></a><a href="#footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg

<div class="sidenote">THE COMET.</div>
<p>The sky was clear, and as night came on the travellers saw a prodigious
   comet blazing above this scene of desolation. On that night, it was chilling
   with a superstitious awe the hamlets of New England and the gilded chambers
   of Versailles; but it is characteristic of La Salle, that, beset as he
   was with perils and surrounded with ghastly images of death, he coolly
   notes down the phenomenon, not as a portentous messenger of war and woe,
   but rather as an object of scientific curiosity.<a name="fnanchor_178" id="fnanchor_178"></a><a href="#footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>
<p>He found his three men safely ensconced upon their island, where they
   were anxiously looking for his return. After collecting a store of half-burnt
   corn from the ravaged granaries of the Illinois, the whole party began
   to ascend the river, and on the sixth of January reached the junction
   of the Kankakee with the northern branch. On their way downward they had
   descended the former stream; they now chose the latter, and soon discovered,
   by the margin <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg
   214]</a></span> of the water, a rude cabin of bark. La Salle landed and
   examined the spot, when an object met his eye which cheered him with a
   bright gleam of hope. It was but a piece of wood; but the wood had been
   cut with a saw. Tonty and his party, then, had passed this way, escaping
   from the carnage behind them. Unhappily, they had left no token of their
   passage at the fork of the two streams; and thus La Salle, on his voyage
   downward, had believed them to be still on the river below.</p>
<p>With rekindled hope, the travellers pursued their journey, leaving their
   canoes, and making their way overland towards the fort on the St. Joseph.</p>
<p>"Snow fell in extraordinary quantities all day," writes La Salle, "and
   it kept on falling for nineteen days in succession, with cold so severe
   that I never knew so hard a winter, even in Canada. We were obliged to
   cross forty leagues of open country, where we could hardly find wood to
   warm ourselves at evening, and could get no bark whatever to make a hut,
   so that we had to spend the night exposed to the furious winds which blow
   over these plains. I never suffered so much from cold, or had more trouble
   in getting forward; for the snow was so light, resting suspended as it
   were among the tall grass, that we could not use snow-shoes. Sometimes
   it was waist deep; and as I walked before my men, as usual, to encourage
   them by breaking the path, I often had much ado, though I am rather tall,
   to lift my legs above the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg
   215]</a></span> drifts, through which I pushed by the weight of my body."</p>
<div class="sidenote">FORT MIAMI.</div>
<p>At length they reached their goal, and found shelter and safety within
   the walls of Fort Miami. Here was the party left in charge of La Forest;
   but, to his surprise and grief, La Salle heard no tidings of Tonty. He
   found some amends for the disappointment in the fidelity and zeal of La
   Forest's men, who had restored the fort, cleared ground for planting,
   and even sawed the planks and timber for a new vessel on the lake.</p>
<p>And now, while La Salle rests at Fort Miami, let us trace the adventures
   which befell Tonty and his followers, after their chief's departure from
   Fort Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur.</p>

   <p>The above may seem exaggerated; but it accords perfectly with what
      is well established concerning the ferocious character of the Iroquois
      and the nature of their warfare. Many other tribes have frequently
      made war upon the dead. I have myself known an instance in which five
      corpses of Sioux Indians placed in trees, after the practice of the
      Western bands of that people, were thrown down and kicked into fragments
      by a war party of the Crows, who then held the muzzles of their guns
      against the skulls, and blew them to pieces. This happened near the
      head of the Platte, in the summer of 1846. Yet the Crows are much less
      ferocious than were the Iroquois in La Salle's time.</p>

      February, 1681, being especially brilliant in January." It was said
      to be the largest ever seen. By observations upon it, Newton demonstrated

<p class="center">TONTY AND THE IROQUOIS.</p>
<div class="smcap" style="padding-left:1.5em; text-indent:-1.5em">The Deserters.&mdash;The

the Iroquois.&mdash;Peril of Tonty.&mdash;A Treacherous Truce.&mdash;Intrepidity
of Tonty.&mdash;Murder of Ribourde.&mdash;War upon the Dead.</div>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> La Salle set out on his rugged journey to Fort Frontenac, he left,
   as we have seen, fifteen men at Fort Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur,&mdash;smiths,
   ship-carpenters, house-wrights, and soldiers, besides his servant L'Esp&eacute;rance
   and the two friars Membr&eacute; and Ribourde. Most of the men were ripe
   for mutiny. They had no interest in the enterprise, and no love for its
   chief. They were disgusted with the present, and terrified at the future.
   La Salle, too, was for the most part a stern commander, impenetrable and
   cold; and when he tried to soothe, conciliate, and encourage, his success
   rarely answered to the excellence of his rhetoric. He could always, however,
   inspire respect, if not love; but now the restraint of his presence was
   removed. He had not been long absent, when a fire-brand was thrown into
   the midst of the discontented and restless crew.</p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg
   217]</a></span></p>
<p>It may be remembered that La Salle had met two of his men, La Chapelle
   and Leblanc, at his fort on the St. Joseph, and ordered them to rejoin
   Tonty. Unfortunately, they obeyed. On arriving, they told their comrades
   that the "Griffin" was lost, that Fort Frontenac was seized by the creditors
   of La Salle, that he was ruined past recovery, and that they, the men,
   would never receive their pay. Their wages were in arrears for more than
   two years; and, indeed, it would have been folly to pay them before their
   return to the settlements, as to do so would have been a temptation to
   desert. Now, however, the effect on their minds was still worse, believing,
   as many of them did, that they would never be paid at all.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE DESERTERS.</div>
<p>La Chapelle and his companion had brought a letter from La Salle to Tonty,
   directing him to examine and fortify the cliff so often mentioned, which
   overhung the river above the great Illinois village. Tonty, accordingly,
   set out on his errand with some of the men. In his absence, the malcontents
   destroyed the fort, stole powder, lead, furs, and provisions, and deserted,
   after writing on the side of the unfinished vessel the words seen by La
   Salle, "<i>Nous sommes tous sauvages</i>."<a name="fnanchor_179" id="fnanchor_179"></a><a href="#footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> The brave <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg
   218]</a></span> young Sieur de Boisrondet and the servant L'Esp&eacute;rance
   hastened to carry the news to Tonty, who at once despatched four of those
   with him, by two different routes, to inform La Salle of the disaster.<a name="fnanchor_180" id="fnanchor_180"></a><a href="#footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
   Besides the two just named, there now remained with him only one hired
   man and the R&eacute;collet friars. With this feeble band, he was left
   among a horde of treacherous savages, who had been taught to regard him
   as a secret enemy. Resolved, apparently, to disarm their jealousy by a
   show of confidence, he took up his abode in the midst of them, making
   his quarters in the great village, whither, as spring opened, its inhabitants
   returned, to the number, according to Membr&eacute;, of seven or eight
   thousand. Hither he conveyed the forge and such tools as he could recover,
   and here he hoped to maintain himself till La Salle should reappear. The
   spring and the summer were past, and he looked anxiously for his coming,
   unconscious that a storm was gathering in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg
   219]</a></span> the east, soon to burst with devastation over the fertile
   wilderness of the Illinois.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE IROQUOIS WAR.</div>
<p>I have recounted the ferocious triumphs of the Iroquois in another volume.<a name="fnanchor_181" id="fnanchor_181"></a><a href="#footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
   Throughout a wide semi-circle around their cantons, they had made the
   forest a solitude; destroyed the Hurons, exterminated the Neutrals and
   the Eries, reduced the formidable Andastes to helpless insignificance,
   swept the borders of the St. Lawrence with fire, spread terror and desolation
   among the Algonquins of Canada; and now, tired of peace, they were seeking,
   to borrow their own savage metaphor, new nations to devour. Yet it was
   not alone their homicidal fury that now impelled them to another war.
   Strange as it may seem, this war was in no small measure one of commercial
   advantage. They had long traded with the Dutch and English of New York,
   who gave them, in exchange for their furs, the guns, ammunition, knives,
   hatchets, kettles, beads, and brandy which had become indispensable to
   them. Game was scarce in their country. They must seek their beaver and
   other skins in the vacant territories of the tribes they had destroyed;
   but this did not content them. The French of Canada were seeking to secure
   a monopoly of the furs of the north and west; and, of late, the enterprises
   of La Salle on the tributaries of the Mississippi had especially roused
   the jealousy of the Iroquois, fomented, moreover, by Dutch and English
   traders.<a name="fnanchor_182" id="fnanchor_182"></a><a href="#footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> These crafty savages would fain <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg
   220]</a></span> reduce all these regions to subjection, and draw thence
   an exhaustless supply of furs, to be bartered for English goods with the
   traders of Albany. They turned their eyes first towards the Illinois,
   the most important, as well as one of the most accessible, of the western
   Algonquin tribes; and among La Salle's enemies were some in whom jealousy
   of a hated rival could so far override all the best interests of the colony
   that they did not scruple to urge on the Iroquois to an invasion which
   they hoped would prove his ruin. The chiefs convened, war was decreed,
   the war-dance was danced, the war-song sung, and five hundred warriors
   began their march. In their path lay the town of the Miamis, neighbors
   and kindred of the Illinois. It was always their policy to divide and
   conquer; and these forest Machiavels had intrigued so well among the Miamis,
   working craftily on their jealousy, that they induced them to join in
   the invasion, though there is every reason to believe that they had marked
   these infatuated allies as their next victims.<a name="fnanchor_183" id="fnanchor_183"></a><a href="#footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">THE ILLINOIS TOWN.</div>
<p>Go to the banks of the Illinois where it flows by the village of Utica,
   and stand on the meadow that borders it on the north. In front glides
   the river, a musket-shot in width; and from the farther bank rises, with
   gradual slope, a range of wooded hills <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg
   221]</a></span> that hide from sight the vast prairie behind them. A mile
   or more on your left these gentle acclivities end abruptly in the lofty
   front of the great cliff, called by the French the Rock of St. Louis,
   looking boldly out from the forests that environ it; and, three miles
   distant on your right, you discern a gap in the steep bluffs that here
   bound the valley, marking the mouth of the river Vermilion, called Aramoni
   by the French.<a name="fnanchor_184" id="fnanchor_184"></a><a href="#footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Now stand in fancy on this same spot in the early
   autumn of the year 1680. You are in the midst of the great town of the
   Illinois,&mdash;hundreds of mat-covered lodges, and thousands of congregated
   savages. Enter one of their dwellings: they will not think you an intruder.
   Some friendly squaw will lay a mat for you by the fire; you may seat yourself
   upon it, smoke your pipe, and study the lodge and its inmates by the light
   that streams through the holes at the top. Three or four fires smoke and
   smoulder on the ground down the middle <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg
   222]</a></span> of the long arched structure; and, as to each fire there
   are two families, the place is somewhat crowded when all are present.
   But now there is breathing room, for many are in the fields. A squaw sits
   weaving a mat of rushes; a warrior, naked except his moccasins, and tattooed
   with fantastic devices, binds a stone arrow-head to its shaft, with the
   fresh sinews of a buffalo. Some lie asleep, some sit staring in vacancy,
   some are eating, some are squatted in lazy chat around a fire. The smoke
   brings water to your eyes; the fleas annoy you; small unkempt children,
   naked as young puppies, crawl about your knees and will not be repelled.
   You have seen enough; you rise and go out again into the sunlight. It
   is, if not a peaceful, at least a languid scene. A few voices break the
   stillness, mingled with the joyous chirping of crickets from the grass.
   Young men lie flat on their faces, basking in the sun; a group of their
   elders are smoking around a buffalo-skin on which they have just been
   playing a game of chance with cherry-stones. A lover and his mistress,
   perhaps, sit together under a shed of bark, without uttering a word. Not
   far off is the graveyard, where lie the dead of the village, some buried
   in the earth, some wrapped in skins and laid aloft on scaffolds, above
   the reach of wolves. In the cornfields around, you see squaws at their
   labor, and children driving off intruding birds; and your eye ranges over
   the meadows beyond, spangled with the yellow blossoms of the resin-weed
   and the Rudbeckia, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg
   223]</a></span> or over the bordering hills still green with the foliage
   of summer.<a name="fnanchor_185" id="fnanchor_185"></a><a href="#footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>
<p>This, or something like it, one may safely affirm, was the aspect of the
   Illinois village at noon of the tenth of September.<a name="fnanchor_186" id="fnanchor_186"></a><a href="#footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> In a hut apart
   from the rest, you would probably have found the Frenchmen. Among them
   was a man, not strong in person, and disabled, moreover, by the loss of
   a hand, yet in this den of barbarism betraying the language and bearing
   of one formed in the most polished civilization of Europe. This was Henri
   de Tonty. The others were young Boisrondet, the servant L'Esp&eacute;rance,
   and a Parisian youth named &Eacute;tienne Renault. The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg
   224]</a></span> friars, Membr&eacute; and Ribourde, were not in the village,
   but at a hut a league distant, whither they had gone to make a "retreat" for
   prayer and meditation. Their missionary labors had not been fruitful;
   they had made no converts, and were in despair at the intractable character
   of the objects of their zeal. As for the other Frenchmen, time, doubtless,
   hung heavy on their hands; for nothing can surpass the vacant monotony
   of an Indian town when there is neither hunting, nor war, nor feasts,
   nor dances, nor gambling, to beguile the lagging hours.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE ALARM.</div>
<p>Suddenly the village was wakened from its lethargy as by the crash of
   a thunderbolt. A Shawanoe, lately here on a visit, had left his Illinois
   friends to return home. He now reappeared, crossing the river in hot haste,
   with the announcement that he had met, on his way, an army of Iroquois
   approaching to attack them. All was panic and confusion. The lodges disgorged
   their frightened inmates; women and children screamed, startled warriors
   snatched their weapons. There were less than five hundred of them, for
   the greater part of the young men had gone to war. A crowd of excited
   savages thronged about Tonty and his Frenchmen, already objects of their
   suspicion, charging them, with furious gesticulation, with having stirred
   up their enemies to invade them. Tonty defended himself in broken Illinois,
   but the naked mob were but half convinced. They seized the forge and tools
   and flung them into the river, with all the goods that had <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg
   225]</a></span> been saved from the deserters; then, distrusting their
   power to defend themselves, they manned the wooden canoes which lay in
   multitudes by the bank, embarked their women and children, and paddled
   down the stream to that island of dry land in the midst of marshes which
   La Salle afterwards found filled with their deserted huts. Sixty warriors
   remained here to guard them, and the rest returned to the village. All
   night long fires blazed along the shore. The excited warriors greased
   their bodies, painted their faces, befeathered their heads, sang their
   war-songs, danced, stamped, yelled, and brandished their hatchets, to
   work up their courage to face the crisis. The morning came, and with it
   came the Iroquois.</p>
<p>Young warriors had gone out as scouts, and now they returned. They had
   seen the enemy in the line of forest that bordered the river Aramoni,
   or Vermilion, and had stealthily reconnoitred them. They were very numerous,<a name="fnanchor_187" id="fnanchor_187"></a><a href="#footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
   and armed for the most part with guns, pistols, and swords. Some had bucklers
   of wood or raw-hide, and some wore those corselets of tough twigs interwoven
   with cordage which their fathers had used when fire-arms were unknown.
   The scouts added more, for they declared that they had seen a Jesuit among
   the Iroquois; nay, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg
   226]</a></span> that La Salle himself was there, whence it must follow
   that Tonty and his men were enemies and traitors. The supposed Jesuit
   was but an Iroquois chief arrayed in a black hat, doublet, and stockings;
   while another, equipped after a somewhat similar fashion, passed in the
   distance for La Salle. But the Illinois were furious. Tonty's life hung
   by a hair. A crowd of savages surrounded him, mad with rage and terror.
   He had come lately from Europe, and knew little of Indians, but, as the
   friar Membr&eacute; says of him, "he was full of intelligence and courage," and
   when they heard him declare that he and his Frenchmen would go with them
   to fight the Iroquois, their threats grew less clamorous and their eyes
   glittered with a less deadly lustre.</p>
<div class="sidenote">TONTY'S MEDIATION.</div>
<p>Whooping and screeching, they ran to their canoes, crossed the river,
   climbed the woody hill, and swarmed down upon the plain beyond. About
   a hundred of them had guns; the rest were armed with bows and arrows.
   They were now face to face with the enemy, who had emerged from the woods
   of the Vermilion, and were advancing on the open prairie. With unwonted
   spirit, for their repute as warriors was by no means high, the Illinois
   began, after their fashion, to charge; that is, they leaped, yelled, and
   shot off bullets and arrows, advancing as they did so; while the Iroquois
   replied with gymnastics no less agile and howlings no less terrific, mingled
   with the rapid clatter of their guns. Tonty saw that it would go hard
   with his allies. It was of the last <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg
   227]</a></span> moment to stop the fight, if possible. The Iroquois were,
   or professed to be, at peace with the French; and, taking counsel of his
   courage, he resolved on an attempt to mediate, which may well be called
   a desperate one. He laid aside his gun, took in his hand a wampum belt
   as a flag of truce, and walked forward to meet the savage multitude, attended
   by Boisrondet, another Frenchman, and a young Illinois who had the hardihood
   to accompany him. The guns of the Iroquois still flashed thick and fast.
   Some of them were aimed at him, on which he sent back the two Frenchmen
   and the Illinois, and advanced alone, holding out the wampum belt.<a name="fnanchor_188" id="fnanchor_188"></a><a href="#footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
   A moment more, and he was among the infuriated warriors. It was a frightful
   spectacle,&mdash;the contorted forms, bounding, crouching, twisting, to
   deal or dodge the shot; the small keen eyes that shone like an angry snake's;
   the parted lips pealing their <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg
   228]</a></span> fiendish yells; the painted features writhing with fear
   and fury, and every passion of an Indian fight,&mdash;man, wolf, and devil,
   all in one.<a name="fnanchor_189" id="fnanchor_189"></a><a href="#footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> With his swarthy complexion and his half-savage dress,
   they thought he was an Indian, and thronged about him, glaring murder.
   A young warrior stabbed at his heart with a knife, but the point glanced
   aside against a rib, inflicting only a deep gash. A chief called out that,
   as his ears were not pierced, he must be a Frenchman. On this, some of
   them tried to stop the bleeding, and led him to the rear, where an angry
   parley ensued, while the yells and firing still resounded in the front.
   Tonty, breathless, and bleeding at the mouth with the force of the blow
   he had received, found words to declare that the Illinois were under the
   protection of the King and the governor of Canada, and to demand that
   they should be left in peace.<a name="fnanchor_190" id="fnanchor_190"></a><a href="#footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">PERIL OF TONTY.</div>
<p>A young Iroquois snatched Tonty's hat, placed it on the end of his gun,
   and displayed it to the Illinois, who, thereupon thinking he was killed, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg
   229]</a></span> renewed the fight; and the firing in front clattered more
   angrily than before. A warrior ran in, crying out that the Iroquois were
   giving ground, and that there were Frenchmen among the Illinois, who fired
   at them. On this, the clamor around Tonty was redoubled. Some wished to
   kill him at once; others resisted. "I was never," he writes, "in such
   perplexity; for at that moment there was an Iroquois behind me, with a
   knife in his hand, lifting my hair as if he were going to scalp me. I
   thought it was all over with me, and that my best hope was that they would
   knock me in the head instead of burning me, as I believed they would do." In
   fact, a Seneca chief demanded that he should be burned; while an Onondaga
   chief, a friend of La Salle, was for setting him free. The dispute grew
   fierce and hot. Tonty told them that the Illinois were twelve hundred
   strong, and that sixty Frenchmen were at the village, ready to back them.
   This invention, though not fully believed, had no little effect. The friendly
   Onondaga carried his point; and the Iroquois, having failed to surprise
   their enemies, as they had hoped, now saw an opportunity to delude them
   by a truce. They sent back Tonty with a belt of peace: he held it aloft
   in sight of the Illinois; chiefs and old warriors ran to stop the fight;
   the yells and the firing ceased; and Tonty, like one waked from a hideous
   nightmare, dizzy, almost fainting with loss of blood, staggered across
   the intervening prairie, to rejoin his friends. He was met by the two
   friars, Ribourde <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg
   230]</a></span> and Membr&eacute;, who in their secluded hut, a league
   from the village, had but lately heard of what was passing, and who now,
   with benedictions and thanksgiving, ran to embrace him as a man escaped
   from the jaws of death.</p>
<p>The Illinois now withdrew, re-embarking in their canoes, and crossing
   again to their lodges; but scarcely had they reached them, when their
   enemies appeared at the edge of the forest on the opposite bank. Many
   found means to cross, and, under the pretext of seeking for provisions,
   began to hover in bands about the skirts of the town, constantly increasing
   in numbers. Had the Illinois dared to remain, a massacre would doubtless
   have ensued; but they knew their foe too well, set fire to their lodges,
   embarked in haste, and paddled down the stream to rejoin their women and
   children at the sanctuary among the morasses. The whole body of the Iroquois
   now crossed the river, took possession of the abandoned town, building
   for themselves a rude redoubt or fort of the trunks of trees and of the
   posts and poles forming the framework of the lodges which escaped the
   fire. Here they ensconced themselves, and finished the work of havoc at
   their leisure.</p>
<p>Tonty and his companions still occupied their hut; but the Iroquois, becoming
   suspicious of them, forced them to remove to the fort, crowded as it was
   with the savage crew. On the second day, there was an alarm. The Illinois
   appeared in numbers on the low hills, half a mile behind the town; and
   the Iroquois, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg
   231]</a></span> who had felt their courage, and who had been told by Tonty
   that they were twice as numerous as themselves, showed symptoms of no
   little uneasiness. They proposed that he should act as mediator, to which
   he gladly assented, and crossed the meadow towards the Illinois, accompanied
   by Membr&eacute;, and by an Iroquois who was sent as a hostage. The Illinois
   hailed the overtures with delight, gave the ambassadors some refreshment,
   which they sorely needed, and sent back with them a young man of their
   nation as a hostage on their part. This indiscreet youth nearly proved
   the ruin of the negotiation; for he was no sooner among the Iroquois than
   he showed such an eagerness to close the treaty, made such promises, professed
   such gratitude, and betrayed so rashly the numerical weakness of the Illinois,
   that he revived all the insolence of the invaders. They turned furiously
   upon Tonty, and charged him with having robbed them of the glory and the
   spoils of victory. "Where are all your Illinois warriors, and where are
   the sixty Frenchmen that you said were among them?" It needed all Tonty's
   tact and coolness to extricate himself from this new danger.</p>
<div class="sidenote">IROQUOIS TREACHERY.</div>
<p>The treaty was at length concluded; but scarcely was it made, when the
   Iroquois prepared to break it, and set about constructing canoes of elm-bark,
   in which to attack the Illinois women and children in their island sanctuary.
   Tonty warned his allies that the pretended peace was but a snare for their
   destruction. The Iroquois, on their part, grew hourly more <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg
   232]</a></span> jealous of him, and would certainly have killed him, had
   it not been their policy to keep the peace with Frontenac and the French.</p>
<p>Several days after, they summoned him and Membr&eacute; to a council.
   Six packs of beaver-skins were brought in; and the savage orator presented
   them to Tonty in turn, explaining their meaning as he did so. The first
   two were to declare that the children of Count Frontenac&mdash;that is,
   the Illinois&mdash;should not be eaten; the next was a plaster to heal
   Tonty's wound; the next was oil wherewith to anoint him and Membr&eacute;,
   that they might not be fatigued in travelling; the next proclaimed that
   the sun was bright; and the sixth and last required them to decamp and
   go home.<a name="fnanchor_191" id="fnanchor_191"></a><a href="#footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Tonty thanked them for their gifts, but demanded when they
   themselves meant to go and leave the Illinois in peace. At this, the conclave
   grew angry; and, despite their late pledge, some of them said that before
   they went they would eat Illinois flesh. Tonty instantly kicked away the
   packs of beaver-skins, the Indian symbol of the scornful rejection of
   a proposal, telling them that since they meant to eat the governor's children
   he would have none of their presents. The chiefs, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg
   233]</a></span> in a rage, rose and drove him from the lodge. The French
   withdrew to their hut, where they stood all night on the watch, expecting
   an attack, and resolved to sell their lives dearly. At daybreak, the chiefs
   ordered them to begone.</p>
<div class="sidenote">MURDER OF RIBOURDE.</div>
<p>Tonty, with admirable fidelity and courage, had done all in the power
   of man to protect the allies of Canada against their ferocious assailants;
   and he thought it unwise to persist further in a course which could lead
   to no good, and which would probably end in the destruction of the whole
   party. He embarked in a leaky canoe with Membr&eacute;, Ribourde, Boisrondet,
   and the remaining two men, and began to ascend the river. After paddling
   about five leagues, they landed to dry their baggage and repair their
   crazy vessel; when Father Ribourde, breviary in hand, strolled across
   the sunny meadows for an hour of meditation among the neighboring groves.
   Evening approached, and he did not return. Tonty, with one of the men,
   went to look for him, and, following his tracks, presently discovered
   those of a band of Indians, who had apparently seized or murdered him.
   Still, they did not despair. They fired their guns to guide him, should
   he still be alive; built a huge fire by the bank, and then, crossing the
   river, lay watching it from the other side. At midnight, they saw the
   figure of a man hovering around the blaze; then many more appeared, but
   Ribourde was not among them. In truth, a band of Kickapoos, enemies of
   the Iroquois, about whose camp they had <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg
   234]</a></span> been prowling in quest of scalps, had met and wantonly
   murdered the inoffensive old man. They carried his scalp to their village,
   and danced round it in triumph, pretending to have taken it from an enemy.
   Thus, in his sixty-fifth year, the only heir of a wealthy Burgundian house
   perished under the war-clubs of the savages for whose salvation he had
   renounced station, ease, and affluence.<a name="fnanchor_192" id="fnanchor_192"></a><a href="#footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">ATTACK OF THE IROQUOIS.</div>
<p>Meanwhile, a hideous scene was enacted at the ruined village of the Illinois.
   Their savage foes, balked of a living prey, wreaked their fury on the
   dead. They dug up the graves; they threw down the scaffolds. Some of the
   bodies they burned; some they threw to the dogs; some, it is affirmed,
   they ate.<a name="fnanchor_193" id="fnanchor_193"></a><a href="#footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Placing the skulls on stakes as trophies, they turned to
   pursue the Illinois, who, when the French withdrew, had abandoned their
   asylum and retreated down the river. The Iroquois, still, it seems, in
   awe of them, followed them along the opposite bank, each night encamping
   face to face <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg
   235]</a></span> with them; and thus the adverse bands moved slowly southward,
   till they were near the mouth of the river. Hitherto, the compact array
   of the Illinois had held their enemies in check; but now, suffering from
   hunger, and lulled into security by the assurances of the Iroquois that
   their object was not to destroy them, but only to drive them from the
   country, they rashly separated into their several tribes. Some descended
   the Mississippi; some, more prudent, crossed to the western side. One
   of their principal tribes, the Tamaroas, more credulous than the rest,
   had the fatuity to remain near the mouth of the Illinois, where they were
   speedily assailed by all the force of the Iroquois. The men fled, and
   very few of them were killed; but the women and children were captured
   to the number, it is said, of seven hundred.<a name="fnanchor_194" id="fnanchor_194"></a><a href="#footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Then followed that scene
   of torture of which, some two weeks later, La Salle saw the revolting
   traces.<a name="fnanchor_195" id="fnanchor_195"></a><a href="#footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Sated, at length, with horrors, the conquerors withdrew,
   leading with them a host of captives, and exulting in their triumphs over
   women, children, and the dead.</p>
<p>After the death of Father Ribourde, Tonty and his companions remained
   searching for him till noon <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg
   236]</a></span> of the next day, and then in despair of again seeing him,
   resumed their journey. They ascended the river, leaving no token of their
   passage at the junction of its northern and southern branches. For food,
   they gathered acorns and dug roots in the meadows. Their canoe proved
   utterly worthless; and, feeble as they were, they set out on foot for
   Lake Michigan. Boisrondet wandered off, and was lost. He had dropped the
   flint of his gun, and he had no bullets; but he cut a pewter porringer
   into slugs, with which he shot wild turkeys by discharging his piece with
   a fire-brand, and after several days he had the good fortune to rejoin
   the party. Their object was to reach the Pottawattamies of Green Bay.
   Had they aimed at Michilimackinac, they would have found an asylum with
   La Forest at the fort on the St. Joseph; but unhappily they passed westward
   of that post, and, by way of Chicago, followed the borders of Lake Michigan
   northward. The cold was intense; and it was no easy task to grub up wild
   onions from the frozen ground to save themselves from starving. Tonty
   fell ill of a fever and a swelling of the limbs, which disabled him from
   travelling, and hence ensued a long delay. At length they neared Green
   Bay, where they would have starved, had they not gleaned a few ears of
   corn and frozen squashes in the fields of an empty Indian town.</p>
<div class="sidenote">FRIENDS IN NEED.</div>
<p>This enabled them to reach the bay, and having patched an old canoe which
   they had the good luck to find, they embarked in it; whereupon, says Tonty, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg
   237]</a></span> "there rose a northwest wind, which lasted five days,
   with driving snow. We consumed all our food; and not knowing what to do
   next, we resolved to go back to the deserted town, and die by a warm fire
   in one of the wigwams. On our way, we saw a smoke; but our joy was short,
   for when we reached the fire we found nobody there. We spent the night
   by it; and before morning the bay froze. We tried to break a way for our
   canoe through the ice, but could not; and therefore we determined to stay
   there another night, and make moccasins in order to reach the town. We
   made some out of Father Gabriel's cloak. I was angry with &Eacute;tienne
   Renault for not finishing his; but he excused himself on account of illness,
   because he had a great oppression of the stomach, caused by eating a piece
   of an Indian shield of raw-hide, which he could not digest. His delay
   proved our salvation; for the next day, December fourth, as I was urging
   him to finish the moccasins, and he was still excusing himself on the
   score of his malady, a party of Kiskakon Ottawas, who were on their way
   to the Pottawattamies, saw the smoke of our fire, and came to us. We gave
   them such a welcome as was never seen before. They took us into their
   canoes, and carried us to an Indian village, only two leagues off. There
   we found five Frenchmen, who received us kindly, and all the Indians seemed
   to take pleasure in sending us food; so that, after thirty-four days of
   starvation, we found our famine turned to abundance."</p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg

<p>This hospitable village belonged to the Pottawattamies, and was under
   the sway of the chief who had befriended La Salle the year before, and
   who was wont to say that he knew but three great captains in the world,&mdash;Frontenac,
   La Salle, and himself.<a name="fnanchor_196" id="fnanchor_196"></a><a href="#footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p class="center">THE ILLINOIS TOWN.</p>
<p class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">The Site of the Great
Illinois Town</span>.&mdash;This has not till now been determined, though there have been various
conjectures concerning it. From a study of the contemporary documents
and maps, I became satisfied, first, that the branch of the
river Illinois, called the "Big Vermilion," was the <i>Aramoni</i> of
the French explorers; and, secondly, that the cliff called "Starved
Rock" was that known to the French as <i>Le Rocher</i>, or the
Rock of St. Louis. If I was right in this conclusion, then the position of
the Great Village was established; for there is abundant proof
that it was on the north side of the river, above the Aramoni, and
below Le Rocher. I accordingly went to the village of Utica,
which, as I judged by the map, was very near the point in question,
and mounted to the top of one of the hills immediately behind it,
whence I could see the valley of the Illinois for miles, bounded
on the farther side by a range of hills, in some parts rocky and
precipitous, and in others covered with forests. Far on the right
was a gap in these hills, through which the Big Vermilion flowed
to join the Illinois; and somewhat towards the left, at the distance
of a mile and a half, was a huge cliff, rising perpendicularly
from the opposite margin of the river. This I assumed to be <i>Le
Rocher</i> of the French, though from where I stood I was unable
to discern the distinctive features which I was prepared to find in
it. In every other respect, the scene before me was precisely
what I had expected to see. There was a meadow on the hither side
of the river, on which stood a farmhouse; and this, as it seemed
to me, by its relations with surrounding objects, might be supposed
to stand in the midst of the space once occupied by the Illinois
town.</p>

<p class="blockquot">On the way down from the hill I met Mr.
James Clark, the principal inhabitant of Utica, and one of the earliest
settlers of this region. I accosted him, told him my objects,
and requested
    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> a half hour's conversation with him, at
his leisure. He seemed interested in the inquiry, and said he
would visit me early in the evening at the inn, where, accordingly,
he soon appeared. The conversation took place in the porch, where
a number of farmers and others were gathered. I asked Mr. Clark
if any Indian remains were found in the neighborhood. "Yes," he replied, "plenty
of them." I then inquired if there was any one spot
where they were more numerous than elsewhere. "Yes," he answered
again, pointing towards the farmhouse on the meadow; "on my farm
down yonder by the river, my tenant ploughs up teeth and bones by
the peck every spring, besides arrow-heads, beads, stone hatchets,
and other things of that sort." I replied that this was precisely
what I had expected, as I had been led to believe that the principal
town of the Illinois Indians once covered that very
spot. "If," I added, "I am right in this belief, the great rock beyond
the river is the one which the first explorers occupied as a
fort; and I can describe it to you from their accounts of it, though
I have never seen it, except from the top of the hill where the
trees on and around it prevented me from seeing any part but the
front." The men present now gathered around to listen. "The rock," I
continued, "is nearly a hundred and fifty feet high, and rises
directly from the water. The front and two sides are perpendicular
and inaccessible; but there is one place where it is possible
for a man to climb up, though with difficulty. The top is large
enough and level enough for houses and fortifications." Here several
of the men exclaimed: "That's just it." "You've hit it exactly." I
then asked if there was any other rock on that side of the
river which could answer to the description. They all agreed that there
was no such rock on either side, along the whole length of
the river. I then said: "If the Indian town was in the place where
I suppose it to have been, I can tell you the nature of the country
which lies behind the hills on the farther side of the river, though
I know nothing about it except what I have learned from writings
nearly two centuries old. From the top of the hills, you look out
upon a great prairie reaching as far as you can see, except
that it is crossed by a belt of woods, following the course of a stream <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> which enters the main river a few miles
below." (See <i>ante</i>, p. 221, <i>note</i>.) "You are exactly right
again," replied Mr. Clark; "we call that belt of timber the 'Vermilion
Woods,' and the stream is the Big Vermilion." "Then," I said, "the
Big Vermilion is the river which the French called the Aramoni; 'Starved
Rock' is the same on which they built a fort called St. Louis,
in the year 1682; and your farm is on the site of the great town
of the Illinois."</p>

<p class="blockquot">I spent the next day in examining these localities, and was fully confirmed
   in my conclusions. Mr. Clark's tenant showed me the spot where the human
   bones were ploughed up. It was no doubt the graveyard violated by the
   Iroquois. The Illinois returned to the village after their defeat, and
   long continued to occupy it. The scattered bones were probably collected
   and restored to their place of burial.</p>

      confirmation of many statements of Hennepin, Tonty, Membr&eacute;,
      and the <i>Relation des D&eacute;couvertes</i>. Hillaret, Leblanc,
      and Le Meilleur, the blacksmith nicknamed La Forge, went off together,
      and the rest seem to have followed afterwards. Hillaret does not admit
      that any goods were wantonly destroyed.</p>
   <p>There is before me a schedule of the debts of La Salle, made after
      his death. It includes a claim of this man for wages to the amount
      of 2,500 livres.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_183" id="footnote_183"></a><a href="#fnanchor_183"> <span class="label">[183]</span></a> There had long been a rankling jealousy between the Miamis and
      the Illinois. According to Membr&eacute;, La Salle's enemies had intrigued
      successfully among the former, as well as among the Iroquois, to induce
      them to take arms against the Illinois.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_184" id="footnote_184"></a><a href="#fnanchor_184"> <span class="label">[184]</span></a> The above is from notes made on the spot. The following is La
      Salle's description of the locality in the <i>Relation des D&eacute;couvertes</i>,
      written in 1681: "La rive gauche de la rivi&egrave;re, du cot&eacute; du
      sud, est occup&eacute;e par un long rocher, fort &eacute;troit et escarp&eacute; presque
      partout, &agrave; la r&eacute;serve d'un endroit de plus d'une lieue
      de longueur, situ&eacute; vis-&agrave;-vis du village, ou le terrain,
      tout couvert de beaux ch&ecirc;nes, s'&eacute;tend par une pente douce
      jusqu'au bord de la rivi&egrave;re. Au del&agrave; de cette hauteur
      est une vaste plaine, qui s'&eacute;tend bien loin du cot&eacute; du
      sud, et qui est travers&eacute;e par la rivi&egrave;re Aramoni, dont
      les bords sont couverts d'une lisi&egrave;re de bois peu large."</p>
   <p>The Aramoni is laid down on the great manuscript map of Franquelin,
      1684, and on the map of Coronelli, 1688. It is, without doubt, the
      Big Vermilion. <i>Aramoni</i> is the Illinois word for "red," or "vermilion." Starved
      Rock, or the Rock of St. Louis, is the highest and steepest escarpment
      of the <i>long rocher</i> above mentioned.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_185" id="footnote_185"></a><a href="#fnanchor_185"> <span class="label">[185]</span></a> The Illinois were an aggregation of distinct though kindred tribes,&mdash;the
      Kaskaskias, the Peorias, the Kahokias, the Tamaroas, the Moingona,
      and others. Their general character and habits were those of other
      Indian tribes; but they were reputed somewhat cowardly and slothful.
      In their manners, they were more licentious than many of their neighbors,
      and addicted to practices which are sometimes supposed to be the result
      of a perverted civilization. Young men enacting the part of women were
      frequently to be seen among them. These were held in great contempt.
      Some of the early travellers, both among the Illinois and among other
      tribes, where the same practice prevailed, mistook them for hermaphrodites.
      According to Charlevoix (<i>Journal Historique</i>, 303), this abuse
      was due in part to a superstition. The Miamis and Piankishaws were
      in close affinities of language and habits with the Illinois. All these
      tribes belonged to the great Algonquin family. The first impressions
      which the French received of them, as recorded in the <i>Relation</i> of
      1671, were singularly favorable; but a closer acquaintance did not
      confirm them. The Illinois traded with the lake tribes, to whom they
      carried slaves taken in war, receiving in exchange guns, hatchets,
      and other French goods. Marquette in <i>Relation</i>, 1670, 91.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_186" id="footnote_186"></a><a href="#fnanchor_186"> <span class="label">[186]</span></a> This is Membr&eacute;'s date. The narratives differ as to the
      day, though all agree as to the month.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_187" id="footnote_187"></a><a href="#fnanchor_187"> <span class="label">[187]</span></a> The <i>Relation des D&eacute;couvertes</i> says, five hundred
      Iroquois and one hundred Shawanoes. Membr&eacute; says that the allies
      were Miamis. He is no doubt right, as the Miamis had promised their
      aid, and the Shawanoes were at peace with the Illinois. Tonty is silent
      on the point.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_188" id="footnote_188"></a><a href="#fnanchor_188"> <span class="label">[188]</span></a> Membr&eacute; says that he went with Tonty: "J'&eacute;tois aussi &agrave; c&ocirc;t&eacute; du
      Sieur de Tonty." This is an invention of the friar's vanity. "Les deux
      p&egrave;res R&eacute;collets &eacute;toient alors dans une cabane &agrave; une
      lieue du village, o&ugrave; ils s'&eacute;toient retir&eacute;s pour
      faire une esp&egrave;ce de retraite, et ils ne furent avertis de l'arriv&eacute;e
      des Iroquois que dans le temps du combat."&mdash;<i>Relation des D&eacute;couvertes</i>. "Je
      rencontrai en chemin les p&egrave;res Gabriel et Zenobe Membr&eacute;,
      qui cherchoient de mes nouvelles."&mdash;Tonty, <i>M&eacute;moire</i>,
      1693. This was on his return from the Iroquois. The <i>Relation</i> confirms
      the statement, as far as concerns Membr&eacute;: "II rencontra le P&egrave;re
      Zenobe [<i>Membr&eacute;</i>], qui venoit pour le secourir, aiant &eacute;t&eacute; averti
      du combat et de sa blessure."</p>
   <p>The perverted <i>Derni&egrave;res D&eacute;couvertes</i>, published
      without authority, under Tonty's name, says that he was attended by
      a slave, whom the Illinois sent with him as interpreter. In his narrative
      of 1684, Tonty speaks of a Sokokis (Saco) Indian who was with the Iroquois
      and who spoke French enough to serve as interpreter.</p>

      fight. The fray was quelled before much mischief was done, by the vigorous

      and the two narratives of Tonty, of 1684 and 1693. They all agree in
      essential points.</p>
   <p>In his letters of this period, La Salle dwells at great length on the
      devices by which, as he believed, his enemies tried to ruin him and
      his enterprise. He is particularly severe against the Jesuit Allouez,
      whom he charges with intriguing "pour commencer la guerre entre les
      Iroquois et les Illinois par le moyen des Miamis qu'on engageoit dans
      cette n&eacute;gociation afin ou de me faire massacrer avec mes gens
      par quelqu'une de ces nations ou de me brouiller avec les Iroquois."&mdash;<i>Lettre
      (&agrave; Thouret?), 22 Ao&ucirc;t, 1682</i>. He gives in detail the
      circumstances on which this suspicion rests, but which are not convincing.
      He says, further, that the Jesuits gave out that Tonty was dead in
      order to discourage the men going to his relief, and that Allouez encouraged
      the deserters, "leur servoit de conseil, b&eacute;nit mesme leurs balles,
      et les asseura plusieurs fois que M. de Tonty auroit la teste cass&eacute;e." He
      also affirms that great pains were taken to spread the report that
      he was himself dead. A Kiskakon Indian, he says, was sent to Tonty
      with a story to this effect; while a Huron named Scortas was sent to
      him (La Salle) with false news of the death of Tonty. The latter confirms
      this statement, and adds that the Illinois had been told "que M. de
      la Salle estoit venu en leur pays pour les donner &agrave; manger aux
      Iroquois."</p>

<p class="center">THE ADVENTURES OF HENNEPIN.</p>
<div class="smcap" style="padding-left:1.5em; text-indent:-1.5em">Hennepin an Impostor:
his Pretended Discovery; his Actual Discovery; Captured by the Sioux.&mdash;The
Upper Mississippi.</div>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was on the last day of the winter that preceded the invasion of the
   Iroquois that Father Hennepin, with his two companions, Accau and Du Gay,
   had set out from Fort Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur to explore the Illinois to its
   mouth. It appears from his own later statements, as well as from those
   of Tonty, that more than this was expected of him, and that La Salle had
   instructed him to explore, not alone the Illinois, but also the Upper
   Mississippi. That he actually did so, there is no reasonable doubt; and
   could he have contented himself with telling the truth, his name would
   have stood high as a bold and vigorous discoverer. But his vicious attempts
   to malign his commander and plunder him of his laurels have wrapped his
   genuine merit in a cloud.</p>
<p>Hennepin's first book was published soon after his return from his travels,
   and while La Salle was still alive. In it he relates the accomplishment
   of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> instructions
   given him, without the smallest intimation that he did more.<a name="fnanchor_197" id="fnanchor_197"></a><a href="#footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Fourteen
   years after, when La Salle was dead, he published another edition of his
   travels,<a name="fnanchor_198" id="fnanchor_198"></a><a href="#footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> in which he advanced a new and surprising pretension. Reasons
   connected with his personal safety, he declares, before compelled him
   to remain silent; but a time at length had come when the truth must be
   revealed. And he proceeds to affirm, that, before ascending the Mississippi,
   he, with his two men, explored its whole course from the Illinois to the
   sea,&mdash;thus anticipating the discovery which forms the crowning laurel
   of La Salle.</p>
<div class="sidenote">HENNEPIN'S RESOLUTION.</div>
<p>"I am resolved," he says, "to make known here to the whole world the mystery
   of this discovery, which I have hitherto concealed, that I might not offend
   the Sieur de la Salle, who wished to keep all the glory and all the knowledge
   of it to himself. It is for this that he sacrificed many persons whose
   lives he exposed, to prevent them from making known what they had seen,
   and thereby crossing his secret plans.... I was certain that if I went
   down the Mississippi, he would not fail to traduce me to my superiors
   for not taking the northern route, which I was to have followed in accordance
   with his desire and the plan we had made together. But I saw myself on
   the point of dying of hunger, and knew not what to do; because the two
   men who were with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg
   244]</a></span> me threatened openly to leave me in the night, and carry
   off the canoe and everything in it, if I prevented them from going down
   the river to the nations below. Finding myself in this dilemma, I thought
   that I ought not to hesitate, and that I ought to prefer my own safety
   to the violent passion which possessed the Sieur de la Salle of enjoying
   alone the glory of this discovery. The two men, seeing that I had made
   up my mind to follow them, promised me entire fidelity; so, after we had
   shaken hands together as a mutual pledge, we set out on our voyage."<a name="fnanchor_199" id="fnanchor_199"></a><a href="#footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>
<p>He then proceeds to recount at length the particulars of his alleged exploration.
   The story was distrusted from the first.<a name="fnanchor_200" id="fnanchor_200"></a><a href="#footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Why had he not told it before?
   An excess of modesty, a lack of self-assertion, or a too sensitive reluctance
   to wound the susceptibilities of others, had never been found among his
   foibles. Yet some, perhaps, might have believed him, had he not in the
   first edition of his book gratuitously and distinctly declared that he
   did not make the voyage in question. "We had some designs," he says, "of
   going down the river Colbert [Mississippi] as far as its mouth; but the
   tribes that took us prisoners gave us no time to navigate this river both
   up and down."<a name="fnanchor_201" id="fnanchor_201"></a><a href="#footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>]</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENNEPIN AN IMPOSTOR.</div>
<p>In declaring to the world the achievement which he had so long concealed
   and so explicitly denied, the worthy missionary found himself in serious
   embarrassment. In his first book, he had stated that on the twelfth of
   March he left the mouth of the Illinois on his way northward, and that
   on the eleventh of April he was captured by the Sioux near the mouth of
   the Wisconsin, five hundred miles above. This would give him only a month
   to make his alleged canoe-voyage from the Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico,
   and again upward to the place of his capture,&mdash;a distance of three
   thousand two hundred and sixty miles. With his means of transportation,
   three months would have been insufficient.<a name="fnanchor_202" id="fnanchor_202"></a><a href="#footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> He saw the difficulty;
   but, on the other hand, he saw that he could not greatly change either
   date without confusing the parts of his narrative which preceded and which
   followed. In this perplexity he chose a middle course, which only involved
   him in additional contradictions. Having, as he affirms, gone down to
   the Gulf and returned to the mouth of the Illinois, he set out thence
   to explore the river above; and he assigns the twenty-fourth of April
   as the date of this departure. This gives him forty-three days for <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg
   246]</a></span> his voyage to the mouth of the river and back. Looking
   further, we find that having left the Illinois on the twenty-fourth he
   paddled his canoe two hundred leagues northward, and was then captured
   by the Sioux on the twelfth of the same month. In short, he ensnares himself
   in a hopeless confusion of dates.<a name="fnanchor_203" id="fnanchor_203"></a><a href="#footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>
<p>Here, one would think, is sufficient reason for rejecting his story; and
   yet the general truth of the descriptions, and a certain verisimilitude
   which marks it, might easily deceive a careless reader and perplex a critical
   one. These, however, are easily explained. Six years before Hennepin published
   his pretended discovery, his brother friar, Father Chr&eacute;tien Le
   Clerc, published an account of the R&eacute;collet missions among the
   Indians, under the title of "&Eacute;tablissement de la Foi." This book,
   offensive to the Jesuits, is said to have been suppressed by order of
   government; but a few copies fortunately survive.<a name="fnanchor_204" id="fnanchor_204"></a><a href="#footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> One of these is
   now before me. It contains the journal of Father Zenobe Membr&eacute;,
   on his descent of the Mississippi in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg
   247]</a></span> 1681, in company with La Salle. The slightest comparison
   of his narrative with that of Hennepin is sufficient to show that the
   latter framed his own story out of incidents and descriptions furnished
   by his brother missionary, often using his very words, and sometimes copying
   entire pages, with no other alterations than such as were necessary to
   make himself, instead of La Salle and his companions, the hero of the
   exploit. The records of literary piracy may be searched in vain for an
   act of depredation more recklessly impudent.<a name="fnanchor_205" id="fnanchor_205"></a><a href="#footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>
<p>Such being the case, what faith can we put in the rest of Hennepin's story?
   Fortunately, there are tests by which the earlier parts of his book can
   be <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> tried;
   and, on the whole, they square exceedingly well with contemporary records
   of undoubted authenticity. Bating his exaggerations respecting the Falls
   of Niagara, his local descriptions, and even his estimates of distance,
   are generally accurate. He constantly, it is true, magnifies his own acts,
   and thrusts himself forward as one of the chiefs of an enterprise to the
   costs of which he had contributed nothing, and to which he was merely
   an appendage; and yet, till he reaches the Mississippi, there can be no
   doubt that in the main he tells the truth. As for his ascent of that river
   to the country of the Sioux, the general statement is fully confirmed
   by La Salle, Tonty, and other contemporary writers.<a name="fnanchor_206" id="fnanchor_206"></a><a href="#footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> For the details
   of the journey we must rest on Hennepin alone, whose account of the country
   and of the peculiar traits of its Indian occupants afford, as far as they
   go, good evidence of truth. Indeed, this part of his narrative could only
   have been written by one well versed in the savage life of this northwestern
   region.<a name="fnanchor_207" id="fnanchor_207"></a><a href="#footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Trusting, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg
   249]</a></span> then, to his own guidance in the absence of better, let
   us follow in the wake of his adventurous canoe.</p>
<div class="sidenote">HIS VOYAGE NORTHWARD.</div>
<p>It was laden deeply with goods belonging to La Salle, and meant by him
   as presents to Indians on the way, though the travellers, it appears,
   proposed to use them in trading on their own account. The friar was still
   wrapped in his gray capote and hood, shod with sandals, and decorated
   with the cord of St. Francis. As for his two companions, Accau<a name="fnanchor_208" id="fnanchor_208"></a><a href="#footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg
   250]</a></span> Du Gay, it is tolerably clear that the former was the
   real leader of the party, though Hennepin, after his custom, thrusts himself
   into the foremost place. Both were somewhat above the station of ordinary
   hired hands; and Du Gay had an uncle who was an ecclesiastic of good credit
   at Amiens, his native place.</p>
<p>In the forests that overhung the river the buds were feebly swelling with
   advancing spring. There was game enough. They killed buffalo, deer, beavers,
   wild turkeys, and now and then a bear swimming in the river. With these,
   and the fish which they caught in abundance, they fared sumptuously, though
   it was the season of Lent. They were exemplary, however, at their devotions.
   Hennepin said prayers at morning and night, and the <i>angelus</i> at
   noon, adding a petition to Saint Anthony of Padua that he would save them
   from the peril that beset their way. In truth, there was a lion in the
   path. The ferocious character of the Sioux, or Dacotah, who occupied the
   region of the Upper Mississippi, was already known to the French; and
   Hennepin, with excellent reason, prayed that it might be his fortune to
   meet them, not by night, but by day.</p>
<div class="sidenote">CAPTURED BY THE SIOUX.</div>
<p>On the eleventh or twelfth of April, they stopped in the afternoon to
   repair their canoe; and Hennepin busied himself in daubing it with pitch,
   while the others cooked a turkey. Suddenly, a fleet of Sioux canoes swept
   into sight, bearing a war-party of a hundred and twenty naked savages,
   who on seeing <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg
   251]</a></span> the travellers raised a hideous clamor; and, some leaping
   ashore and others into the water, they surrounded the astonished Frenchmen
   in an instant.<a name="fnanchor_209" id="fnanchor_209"></a><a href="#footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Hennepin held out the peace-pipe; but one of them
   snatched it from him. Next, he hastened to proffer a gift of Martinique
   tobacco, which was better received. Some of the old warriors repeated
   the name <i>Miamiha</i>, giving him to understand that they were a war-party,
   on the way to attack the Miamis; on which, Hennepin, with the help of
   signs and of marks which he drew on the sand with a stick, explained that
   the Miamis had gone across the Mississippi, beyond their reach. Hereupon,
   he says that three or four old men placed their hands on his head, and
   began a dismal wailing; while he with his handkerchief wiped away their
   tears, in order to evince sympathy with their affliction, from whatever
   cause arising. Notwithstanding this demonstration of tenderness, they
   refused to smoke with him in his peace-pipe, and forced him and his companions
   to embark and paddle across the river; while they all followed behind,
   uttering yells and howlings which froze the missionary's blood.</p>
<p>On reaching the farther side, they made their camp-fires, and allowed
   their prisoners to do the same. Accau and Du Gay slung their kettle; while <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg
   252]</a></span> Hennepin, to propitiate the Sioux, carried to them two
   turkeys, of which there were several in the canoe. The warriors had seated
   themselves in a ring, to debate on the fate of the Frenchmen; and two
   chiefs presently explained to the friar, by significant signs, that it
   had been resolved that his head should be split with a war-club. This
   produced the effect which was no doubt intended. Hennepin ran to the canoe,
   and quickly returned with one of the men, both loaded with presents, which
   he threw into the midst of the assembly; and then, bowing his head, offered
   them at the same time a hatchet with which to kill him, if they wished
   to do so. His gifts and his submission seemed to appease them. They gave
   him and his companions a dish of beaver's flesh; but, to his great concern,
   they returned his peace-pipe,&mdash;an act which he interpreted as a sign
   of danger. That night the Frenchmen slept little, expecting to be murdered
   before morning. There was, in fact, a great division of opinion among
   the Sioux. Some were for killing them and taking their goods; while others,
   eager above all things that French traders should come among them with
   the knives, hatchets, and guns of which they had heard the value, contended
   that it would be impolitic to discourage the trade by putting to death
   its pioneers.</p>
<p>Scarcely had morning dawned on the anxious captives, when a young chief,
   naked, and painted from head to foot, appeared before them and asked for
   the pipe, which the friar gladly gave him. He filled it, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg
   253]</a></span> smoked it, made the warriors do the same, and, having
   given this hopeful pledge of amity, told the Frenchmen that, since the
   Miamis were out of reach, the war-party would return home, and that they
   must accompany them. To this Hennepin gladly agreed, having, as he declares,
   his great work of exploration so much at heart that he rejoiced in the
   prospect of achieving it even in their company.</p>
<div class="sidenote">SUSPECTED OF SORCERY.</div>
<p>He soon, however, had a foretaste of the affliction in store for him;
   for when he opened his breviary and began to mutter his morning devotion,
   his new companions gathered about him with faces that betrayed their superstitious
   terror, and gave him to understand that his book was a bad spirit with
   which he must hold no more converse. They thought, indeed, that he was
   muttering a charm for their destruction. Accau and Du Gay, conscious of
   the danger, begged the friar to dispense with his devotions, lest he and
   they alike should be tomahawked; but Hennepin says that his sense of duty
   rose superior to his fears, and that he was resolved to repeat his office
   at all hazards, though not until he had asked pardon of his two friends
   for thus imperilling their lives. Fortunately, he presently discovered
   a device by which his devotion and his prudence were completely reconciled.
   He ceased the muttering which had alarmed the Indians, and, with the breviary
   open on his knees, sang the service in loud and cheerful tones. As this
   had no savor of sorcery, and as they now imagined that the book was teaching
   its owner <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> to
   sing for their amusement, they conceived a favorable opinion of both alike.</p>
<p>These Sioux, it may be observed, were the ancestors of those who committed
   the horrible but not unprovoked massacres of 1862, in the valley of the
   St. Peter. Hennepin complains bitterly of their treatment of him, which,
   however, seems to have been tolerably good. Afraid that he would lag behind,
   as his canoe was heavy and slow,<a name="fnanchor_210" id="fnanchor_210"></a><a href="#footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> they placed several warriors in
   it to aid him and his men in paddling. They kept on their way from morning
   till night, building huts for their bivouac when it rained, and sleeping
   on the open ground when the weather was fair,&mdash;which, says Hennepin, "gave
   us a good opportunity to contemplate the moon and stars." The three Frenchmen
   took the precaution of sleeping at the side of the young chief who had
   been the first to smoke the peace-pipe, and who seemed inclined to befriend
   them; but there was another chief, one Aquipaguetin, a crafty old savage,
   who having lost a son in war with the Miamis, was angry that the party
   had abandoned their expedition, and thus deprived him of his revenge.
   He therefore kept up a dismal lament through half the night; while other
   old men, crouching over Hennepin as he lay trying to sleep, stroked him
   with their hands, and uttered wailings so lugubrious that he was forced
   to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> the
   belief that he had been doomed to death, and that they were charitably
   bemoaning his fate.<a name="fnanchor_211" id="fnanchor_211"></a><a href="#footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">THE CAPTIVE FRIAR.</div>
<p>One night, the captives were, for some reason, unable to bivouac near
   their protector, and were forced to make their fire at the end of the
   camp. Here they were soon beset by a crowd of Indians, who told them that
   Aquipaguetin had at length resolved to tomahawk them. The malcontents
   were gathered in a knot at a little distance, and Hennepin hastened to
   appease them by another gift of knives and tobacco. This was but one of
   the devices of the old chief to deprive them of their goods without robbing
   them outright. He had with him the bones of a deceased relative, which
   he was carrying home wrapped in skins prepared with smoke after the Indian
   fashion, and gayly decorated with bands of dyed porcupine quills. He would
   summon his warriors, and placing these relics in the midst of the assembly,
   call on all present to smoke in their honor; after which, Hennepin was
   required to offer a more substantial tribute in the shape of cloth, beads,
   hatchets, tobacco, and the like, to be laid upon the bundle of bones.
   The gifts thus acquired were then, in the name of the deceased, distributed
   among the persons present.</p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg
   256]</a></span></p>
<p>On one occasion, Aquipaguetin killed a bear, and invited the chiefs and
   warriors to feast upon it. They accordingly assembled on a prairie, west
   of the river, where, after the banquet, they danced a "medicine-dance." They
   were all painted from head to foot, with their hair oiled, garnished with
   red and white feathers, and powdered with the down of birds. In this guise
   they set their arms akimbo, and fell to stamping with such fury that the
   hard prairie was dented with the prints of their moccasins; while the
   chief's son, crying at the top of his throat, gave to each in turn the
   pipe of war. Meanwhile, the chief himself, singing in a loud and rueful
   voice, placed his hands on the heads of the three Frenchmen, and from
   time to time interrupted his music to utter a vehement harangue. Hennepin
   could not understand the words, but his heart sank as the conviction grew
   strong within him that these ceremonies tended to his destruction. It
   seems, however, that, after all the chief's efforts, his party was in
   the minority, the greater part being adverse to either killing or robbing
   the three strangers.</p>
<p>Every morning, at daybreak, an old warrior shouted the signal of departure;
   and the recumbent savages leaped up, manned their birchen fleet, and plied
   their paddles against the current, often without waiting to break their
   fast. Sometimes they stopped for a buffalo-hunt on the neighboring prairies;
   and there was no lack of provisions. They passed Lake Pepin, which Hennepin
   called the Lake of Tears, by reason <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg
   257]</a></span> of the howlings and lamentations here uttered over him
   by Aquipaguetin, and nineteen days after his capture landed near the site
   of St. Paul. The father's sorrows now began in earnest. The Indians broke
   his canoe to pieces, having first hidden their own among the alder-bushes.
   As they belonged to different bands and different villages, their mutual
   jealousy now overcame all their prudence; and each proceeded to claim
   his share of the captives and the booty. Happily, they made an amicable
   distribution, or it would have fared ill with the three Frenchmen; and
   each taking his share, not forgetting the priestly vestments of Hennepin,
   the splendor of which they could not sufficiently admire, they set out
   across the country for their villages, which lay towards the north in
   the neighborhood of Lake Buade, now called Mille Lac.</p>
<div class="sidenote">A HARD JOURNEY.</div>
<p>Being, says Hennepin, exceedingly tall and active, they walked at a prodigious
   speed, insomuch that no European could long keep pace with them. Though
   the month of May had begun, there were frosts at night; and the marshes
   and ponds were glazed with ice, which cut the missionary's legs as he
   waded through. They swam the larger streams, and Hennepin nearly perished
   with cold as he emerged from the icy current. His two companions, who
   were smaller than he, and who could not swim, were carried over on the
   backs of the Indians. They showed, however, no little endurance; and he
   declares that he should have dropped by the way, but for their <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg
   258]</a></span> support. Seeing him disposed to lag, the Indians, to spur
   him on, set fire to the dry grass behind him, and then, taking him by
   the hands, ran forward with him to escape the flames. To add to his misery,
   he was nearly famished, as they gave him only a small piece of smoked
   meat once a day, though it does not appear that they themselves fared
   better. On the fifth day, being by this time in extremity, he saw a crowd
   of squaws and children approaching over the prairie, and presently descried
   the bark lodges of an Indian town. The goal was reached. He was among
   the homes of the Sioux.</p>

      was more than three months and a half in making the journey. A Mississippi
      trading-boat of the last generation, with sails and oars, ascending
      against the current, was thought to do remarkably well if it could
      make twenty miles a day. Hennepin, if we believe his own statements,
      must have ascended at an average rate of sixty miles, though his canoe
      was large and heavily laden.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_203" id="footnote_203"></a><a href="#fnanchor_203"> <span class="label">[203]</span></a> Hennepin here falls into gratuitous inconsistencies. In the edition
      of 1697, in order to gain a little time, he says that he left the Illinois
      on his voyage southward on the eighth of March, 1680; and yet in the
      preceding chapter he repeats the statement of the first edition, that
      he was detained at the Illinois by floating ice till the twelfth. Again,
      he says in the first edition that he was captured by the Sioux on the
      eleventh of April; and in the edition of 1697 he changes this date
      to the twelfth, without gaining any advantage by doing so.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_204" id="footnote_204"></a><a href="#fnanchor_204"> <span class="label">[204]</span></a> Le Clerc's book had been made the text of an attack on the Jesuits.

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_205" id="footnote_205"></a><a href="#fnanchor_205"> <span class="label">[205]</span></a> Hennepin may have copied from the unpublished journal of Membr&eacute;,
      which the latter had placed in the hands of his Superior; or he may
      have compiled from Le Clerc's book, relying on the suppression of the
      edition to prevent detection. He certainly saw and used it; for he
      elsewhere borrows the exact words of the editor. He is so careless
      that he steals from Membr&eacute; passages which he might easily have
      written for himself; as, for example, a description of the opossum
      and another of the cougar,&mdash;animals with which he was acquainted.
      Compare the following pages of the <i>Nouvelle D&eacute;couverte</i> with
      the corresponding pages of Le Clerc: Hennepin, 252, Le Clerc, ii. 217;
      H. 253, Le C. ii. 218; H. 257, Le C. ii. 221; H. 259, Le C. ii. 224;
      H. 262, Le C. ii. 226; H. 265, Le C. ii. 229; H. 267, Le C. ii. 233;
      H. 270, Le C. ii. 235; H. 280, Le C. ii. 240; H. 295, Le C. ii. 249;
      H. 296, Le C. ii. 250; H. 297, Le C. ii. 253; H. 299, Le C. ii. 254;
      H. 301, Le C. ii. 257. Some of these parallel passages will be found
      in Sparks's <i>Life of La Salle</i>, where this remarkable fraud was
      first fully exposed. In Shea's <i>Discovery of the Mississippi</i>,
      there is an excellent critical examination of Hennepin's works. His
      plagiarisms from Le Clerc are not confined to the passages cited above;
      for in his later editions he stole largely from other parts of the
      suppressed <i>&Eacute;tablissement de la Foi</i>.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_206" id="footnote_206"></a><a href="#fnanchor_206"> <span class="label">[206]</span></a> It is certain that persons having the best means of information
      believed at the time in Hennepin's story of his journeys on the Upper
      Mississippi. The compiler of the <i>Relation des D&eacute;couvertes</i>,
      who was in close relations with La Salle and those who acted with him,
      does not intimate a doubt of the truth of the report which Hennepin
      on his return gave to the Provincial Commissary of his Order, and which
      is in substance the same which he published two years later. The <i>Relation</i>,
      it is to be observed, was written only a few months after the return
      of Hennepin, and embodies the pith of his narrative of the Upper Mississippi,
      no part of which had then been published.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_207" id="footnote_207"></a><a href="#fnanchor_207"> <span class="label">[207]</span></a> In this connection, it is well to examine the various Sioux words
      which Hennepin uses incidentally, and which he must have acquired by
      personal intercourse with the tribe, as no Frenchman then understood
      the language. These words, as far as my information reaches, are in
      every instance correct. Thus, he says that the Sioux called his breviary
      a "bad spirit,"&mdash;<i>Ouackanch&eacute;</i>. <i>Wakanshe</i>, or <i>Wakanshecha</i>,
      would express the same meaning in modern English spelling. He says
      elsewhere that they called the guns of his companions <i>Manzaouackanch&eacute;</i>,
      which he translates, "iron possessed with a bad spirit." The western
      Sioux to this day call a gun <i>Manzawakan</i>, "metal possessed with
      a spirit." <i>Chonga (shonka)</i>, "a dog," <i>Ouasi (wahsee)</i>, "a
      pine-tree," <i>Chinnen (shinnan)</i>, "a robe," or "garment," and other
      words, are given correctly, with their interpretations. The word <i>Louis</i>,
      affirmed by Hennepin to mean "the sun," seems at first sight a wilful
      inaccuracy, as this is not the word used in general by the Sioux. The
      Yankton band of this people, however, call the sun <i>oouee</i>, which,
      it is evident, represents the French pronunciation of <i>Louis</i>,
      omitting the initial letter. This Hennepin would be apt enough to supply,
      thereby conferring a compliment alike on himself, Louis Hennepin, and
      on the King, Louis XIV., who, to the indignation of his brother monarchs,
      had chosen the sun as his emblem.</p>
   <p>Various trivial incidents touched upon by Hennepin, while recounting
      his life among the Sioux, seem to me to afford a strong presumption
      of an actual experience. I speak on this point with the more confidence,
      as the Indians in whose lodges I was once domesticated for several
      weeks belonged to a western band of the same people.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_208" id="footnote_208"></a><a href="#fnanchor_208"> <span class="label">[208]</span></a> Called Ako by Hennepin. In contemporary documents, it is written
      Accau, Acau, D'Accau, Dacau, Dacan, and D'Accault.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_209" id="footnote_209"></a><a href="#fnanchor_209"> <span class="label">[209]</span></a> The edition of 1683 says that there were thirty-three canoes;
      that of 1697 raises the number to fifty. The number of Indians is the
      same in both. The later narrative is more in detail than the former.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_210" id="footnote_210"></a><a href="#fnanchor_210"> <span class="label">[210]</span></a> And yet it had, by his account, made a distance of thirteen hundred
      and eighty miles from the mouth of the Mississippi upward in twenty-four
      days!</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_211" id="footnote_211"></a><a href="#fnanchor_211"> <span class="label">[211]</span></a> This weeping and wailing over Hennepin once seemed to me an anomaly
      in his account of Sioux manners, as I am not aware that such practices
      are to be found among them at present. They are mentioned, however,
      by other early writers. Le Sueur, who was among them in 1699-1700,
      was wept over no less than Hennepin. See the abstract of his journal
      in La Harpe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Hennepin entered the village, he beheld a sight which caused him to
   invoke Saint Anthony of Padua. In front of the lodges were certain stakes,
   to which were attached bundles of straw, intended, as he supposed, for
   burning him and his friends alive. His concern was redoubled when he saw
   the condition of the Picard Du Gay, whose hair and face had been painted
   with divers colors, and whose head was decorated with a tuft of white
   feathers. In this guise he was entering the village, followed by a crowd
   of Sioux, who compelled him to sing and keep time to his own music by
   rattling a dried gourd containing a number of pebbles. The omens, indeed,
   were exceedingly <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg
   260]</a></span> threatening; for treatment like this was usually followed
   by the speedy immolation of the captive. Hennepin ascribes it to the effect
   of his invocations, that, being led into one of the lodges, among a throng
   of staring squaws and children, he and his companions were seated on the
   ground, and presented with large dishes of birch-bark, containing a mess
   of wild rice boiled with dried whortleberries,&mdash;a repast which he
   declares to have been the best that had fallen to his lot since the day
   of his captivity.<a name="fnanchor_212" id="fnanchor_212"></a><a href="#footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SIOUX.</div>
<p>This soothed his fears; but, as he allayed his famished appetite, he listened
   with anxious interest to the vehement jargon of the chiefs and warriors,
   who were disputing among themselves to whom the three captives should
   respectively belong; for it seems that, as far as related to them, the
   question of distribution had not yet been definitely settled. The debate
   ended in the assigning of Hennepin to his old enemy Aquipaguetin, who,
   however, far from persisting in his evil designs, adopted him on the spot
   as his son. The three companions must now part company. Du Gay, not yet
   quite reassured of his safety, hastened to confess himself to Hennepin;
   but Accau proved refractory, and refused the offices of religion, which
   did not prevent the friar from embracing them both, as he says, with an
   extreme tenderness. Tired as he was, he was forced to set out with his
   self-styled father to his village, which was fortunately <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg
   262]</a></span> not far off. An unpleasant walk of a few miles through
   woods and marshes brought them to the borders of a sheet of water, apparently
   Lake Buade, where five of Aquipaguetin's wives received the party in three
   canoes, and ferried them to an island on which the village stood.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the chief's lodge, Hennepin was met by a decrepit old
   Indian, withered with age, who offered him the peace-pipe, and placed
   him on a bear-skin which was spread by the fire. Here, to relieve his
   fatigue,&mdash;for he was well-nigh spent,&mdash;a small boy anointed
   his limbs with the fat of a wild-cat, supposed to be sovereign in these
   cases by reason of the great agility of that animal. His new father gave
   him a bark-platter of fish, covered him with a buffalo-robe, and showed
   him six or seven of his wives, who were thenceforth, he was told, to regard
   him as a son. The chief's household was numerous; and his allies and relatives
   formed a considerable clan, of which the missionary found himself an involuntary
   member. He was scandalized when he saw one of his adopted brothers carrying
   on his back the bones of a deceased friend, wrapped in the chasuble of
   brocade which they had taken with other vestments from his box.</p>
<div class="sidenote">HENNEPIN AS A MISSIONARY.</div>
<p>Seeing their new relative so enfeebled that he could scarcely stand, the
   Indians made for him one of their sweating baths,<a name="fnanchor_213" id="fnanchor_213"></a><a href="#footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> where they immersed
   him <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> in
   steam three times a week,&mdash;a process from which he thinks he derived
   great benefit. His strength gradually returned, in spite of his meagre
   fare; for there was a dearth of food, and the squaws were less attentive
   to his wants than to those of their children. They respected him, however,
   as a person endowed with occult powers, and stood in no little awe of
   a pocket compass which he had with him, as well as of a small metal pot
   with feet moulded after the face of a lion. This last seemed in their
   eyes a "medicine" of the most formidable nature, and they would not touch
   it without first wrapping it in a beaver-skin. For the rest, Hennepin
   made himself useful in various ways. He shaved the heads of the children,
   as was the custom of the tribe; bled certain asthmatic persons, and dosed
   others with orvietan, the famous panacea of his time, of which he had
   brought with him a good supply. With respect to his missionary functions,
   he seems to have given himself little trouble, unless his attempt to make
   a Sioux vocabulary is to be regarded as preparatory to a future apostleship. "I
   could gain nothing over them," he says, "in the way of their salvation,
   by reason of their natural stupidity." Nevertheless, on one occasion,
   he baptized a sick child, naming it Antoinette in honor of Saint Anthony
   of Padua. It seemed to revive after the rite, but soon relapsed and presently <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg
   264]</a></span> died, "which," he writes, "gave me great joy and satisfaction." In
   this he was like the Jesuits, who could find nothing but consolation in
   the death of a newly baptized infant, since it was thus assured of a paradise
   which, had it lived, it would probably have forfeited by sharing in the
   superstitions of its parents.</p>
<p>With respect to Hennepin and his Indian father, there seems to have been
   little love on either side; but Ouasicoud&eacute;, the principal chief
   of the Sioux of this region, was the fast friend of the three white men.
   He was angry that they had been robbed, which he had been unable to prevent,
   as the Sioux had no laws, and their chiefs little power; but he spoke
   his mind freely, and told Aquipaguetin and the rest, in full council,
   that they were like a dog who steals a piece of meat from a dish and runs
   away with it. When Hennepin complained of hunger, the Indians had always
   promised him that early in the summer he should go with them on a buffalo
   hunt, and have food in abundance. The time at length came, and the inhabitants
   of all the neighboring villages prepared for departure. To each band was
   assigned its special hunting-ground, and he was expected to accompany
   his Indian father. To this he demurred; for he feared lest Aquipaguetin,
   angry at the words of the great chief, might take this opportunity to
   revenge the insult put upon him. He therefore gave out that he expected
   a party of "Spirits"&mdash;that is to say, Frenchmen&mdash;to meet him <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg
   265]</a></span> at the mouth of the Wisconsin, bringing a supply of goods
   for the Indians; and he declares that La Salle had in fact promised to
   send traders to that place. Be this as it may, the Indians believed him;
   and, true or false, the assertion, as will be seen, answered the purpose
   for which it was made.</p>
<div class="sidenote">CAMP OF SAVAGES.</div>
<p>The Indians set out in a body to the number of two hundred and fifty warriors,
   with their women and children. The three Frenchmen, who though in different
   villages had occasionally met during the two months of their captivity,
   were all of the party. They descended Rum River, which forms the outlet
   of Mille Lac, and which is called the St. Francis by Hennepin. None of
   the Indians had offered to give him passage; and, fearing lest he should
   be abandoned, he stood on the bank, hailing the passing canoes and begging
   to be taken in. Accau and Du Gay presently appeared, paddling a small
   canoe which the Indians had given them; but they would not listen to the
   missionary's call, and Accau, who had no love for him, cried out that
   he had paddled him long enough already. Two Indians, however, took pity
   on him, and brought him to the place of encampment, where Du Gay tried
   to excuse himself for his conduct; but Accau was sullen, and kept aloof.</p>
<p>After reaching the Mississippi, the whole party encamped together opposite
   to the mouth of Rum River, pitching their tents of skin, or building their
   bark-huts, on the slope of a hill by the side of the water. It was a wild
   scene, this camp of savages <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg
   266]</a></span> among whom as yet no traders had come and no handiwork
   of civilization had found its way,&mdash;the tall warriors, some nearly
   naked, some wrapped in buffalo-robes, and some in shirts of dressed deer-skin
   fringed with hair and embroidered with dyed porcupine quills, war-clubs
   of stone in their hands, and quivers at their backs filled with stone-headed
   arrows; the squaws, cutting smoke-dried meat with knives of flint, and
   boiling it in rude earthen pots of their own making, driving away, meanwhile,
   with shrill cries, the troops of lean dogs, which disputed the meal with
   a crew of hungry children. The whole camp, indeed, was threatened with
   starvation. The three white men could get no food but unripe berries,&mdash;from
   the effects of which Hennepin thinks they might all have died, but for
   timely doses of his orvietan.</p>
<div class="sidenote">FALLS OF ST. ANTHONY.</div>
<p>Being tired of the Indians, he became anxious to set out for the Wisconsin
   to find the party of Frenchmen, real or imaginary, who were to meet him
   at that place. That he was permitted to do so was due to the influence
   of the great chief Ouasicoud&eacute;, who always befriended him, and who
   had soundly berated his two companions for refusing him a seat in their
   canoe. Du Gay wished to go with him; but Accau, who liked the Indian life
   as much as he disliked Hennepin, preferred to remain with the hunters.
   A small birch-canoe was given to the two adventurers, together with an
   earthen pot; and they had also between them a gun, a knife, and a robe
   of beaver-skin. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg
   267]</a></span> Thus equipped, they began their journey, and soon approached
   the Falls of St. Anthony, so named by Hennepin in honor of the inevitable
   Saint Anthony of Padua.<a name="fnanchor_214" id="fnanchor_214"></a><a href="#footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> As they were carrying their canoe by the
   cataract, they saw five or six Indians, who had gone before, and one of
   whom had climbed into an oak-tree beside the principal fall, whence in
   a loud and lamentable voice he was haranguing the spirit of the waters,
   as a sacrifice to whom he had just hung a robe of beaver-skin among the
   branches.<a name="fnanchor_215" id="fnanchor_215"></a><a href="#footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Their attention was soon engrossed by another object. Looking
   over the edge of the cliff which overhung the river below the falls, Hennepin
   saw a snake, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg
   268]</a></span> which, as he avers, was six feet long,<a name="fnanchor_216" id="fnanchor_216"></a><a href="#footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> writhing upward
   towards the holes of the swallows in the face of the precipice, in order
   to devour their young. He pointed him out to Du Gay, and they pelted him
   with stones till he fell into the river, but not before his contortions
   and the darting of his forked tongue had so affected the Picard's imagination
   that he was haunted that night with a terrific incubus.</p>
<div class="sidenote">ADVENTURES.</div>
<p>They paddled sixty leagues down the river in the heats of July, and killed
   no large game but a single deer, the meat of which soon spoiled. Their
   main resource was the turtles, whose shyness and watchfulness caused them
   frequent disappointments and many involuntary fasts. They once captured
   one of more than common size; and, as they were endeavoring to cut off
   his head, he was near avenging himself by snapping off Hennepin's finger.
   There was a herd of buffalo in sight on the neighboring prairie; and Du
   Gay went with his gun in pursuit of them, leaving the turtle in Hennepin's
   custody. Scarcely was he gone when the friar, raising his eyes, saw that
   their canoe, which they had left at the edge of the water, had floated
   out into the current. Hastily turning the turtle on his back, he covered
   him with his habit of St. Francis, on which, for greater security, he
   laid a number of stones, and then, being a good swimmer, struck out in
   pursuit of the canoe, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg
   269]</a></span> which he at length overtook. Finding that it would overset
   if he tried to climb into it, he pushed it before him to the shore, and
   then paddled towards the place, at some distance above, where he had left
   the turtle. He had no sooner reached it than he heard a strange sound,
   and beheld a long file of buffalo&mdash;bulls, cows, and calves&mdash;entering
   the water not far off, to cross to the western bank. Having no gun, as
   became his apostolic vocation, he shouted to Du Gay, who presently appeared,
   running in all haste, and they both paddled in pursuit of the game. Du
   Gay aimed at a young cow, and shot her in the head. She fell in shallow
   water near an island, where some of the herd had landed; and being unable
   to drag her out, they waded into the water and butchered her where she
   lay. It was forty-eight hours since they had tasted food. Hennepin made
   a fire, while Du Gay cut up the meat. They feasted so bountifully that
   they both fell ill, and were forced to remain two days on the island,
   taking doses of orvietan, before they were able to resume their journey.</p>
<p>Apparently they were not sufficiently versed in woodcraft to smoke the
   meat of the cow; and the hot sun soon robbed them of it. They had a few
   fishhooks, but were not always successful in the use of them. On one occasion,
   being nearly famished, they set their line, and lay watching it, uttering
   prayers in turn. Suddenly, there was a great turmoil in the water. Du
   Gay ran to the line, and, with the help <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg
   270]</a></span> of Hennepin, drew in two large cat-fish.<a name="fnanchor_217" id="fnanchor_217"></a><a href="#footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> The eagles,
   or fish-hawks, now and then dropped a newly caught fish, of which they
   gladly took possession; and once they found a purveyor in an otter which
   they saw by the bank, devouring some object of an appearance so wonderful
   that Du Gay cried out that he had a devil between his paws. They scared
   him from his prey, which proved to be a spade-fish, or, as Hennepin correctly
   describes it, a species of sturgeon, with a bony projection from his snout
   in the shape of a paddle. They broke their fast upon him, undeterred by
   this eccentric appendage.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI.</div>
<p>If Hennepin had had an eye for scenery, he would have found in these his
   vagabond rovings wherewith to console himself in some measure for his
   frequent fasts. The young Mississippi, fresh from its northern springs,
   unstained as yet by unhallowed union with the riotous Missouri, flowed
   calmly on its way amid strange and unique beauties,&mdash;a wilderness,
   clothed with velvet grass; forest-shadowed valleys; lofty heights, whose
   smooth slopes seemed levelled with the scythe; domes and pinnacles, ramparts
   and ruined towers, the work of no human hand. The canoe of the voyagers,
   borne on the tranquil current, glided in the shade of gray crags festooned
   with honeysuckles; by trees mantled with wild grape-vines; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg
   271]</a></span> dells bright with the flowers of the white euphorbia,
   the blue gentian, and the purple balm; and matted forests, where the red
   squirrels leaped and chattered. They passed the great cliff whence the
   Indian maiden threw herself in her despair;<a name="fnanchor_218" id="fnanchor_218"></a><a href="#footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> and Lake Pepin lay before
   them, slumbering in the July sun,&mdash;the far-reaching sheets of sparkling
   water, the woody slopes, the tower-like crags, the grassy heights basking
   in sunlight or shadowed by the passing cloud; all the fair outline of
   its graceful scenery, the finished and polished master-work of Nature.
   And when at evening they made their bivouac fire and drew up their canoe,
   while dim, sultry clouds veiled the west, and the flashes of the silent
   heat-lightning gleamed on the leaden water, they could listen, as they
   smoked their pipes, to the mournful cry of the whippoorwills and the quavering
   scream of the owls.</p>
<p>Other thoughts than the study of the picturesque occupied the mind of
   Hennepin when one day he saw his Indian father, Aquipaguetin, whom he
   had supposed five hundred miles distant, descending the river with ten
   warriors in canoes. He was eager to be the first to meet the traders,
   who, as Hennepin had given out, were to come with their goods to the mouth
   of the Wisconsin. The two travellers trembled <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg
   272]</a></span> for the consequences of this encounter; but the chief,
   after a short colloquy, passed on his way. In three days he returned in
   ill-humor, having found no traders at the appointed spot. The Picard was
   absent at the time, looking for game; and Hennepin was sitting under the
   shade of his blanket, which he had stretched on forked sticks to protect
   him from the sun, when he saw his adopted father approaching with a threatening
   look, and a war-club in his hand. He attempted no violence, however, but
   suffered his wrath to exhale in a severe scolding, after which he resumed
   his course up the river with his warriors.</p>
<p>If Hennepin, as he avers, really expected a party of traders at the Wisconsin,
   the course he now took is sufficiently explicable. If he did not expect
   them, his obvious course was to rejoin Tonty on the Illinois, for which
   he seems to have had no inclination; or to return to Canada by way of
   the Wisconsin,&mdash;an attempt which involved the risk of starvation,
   as the two travellers had but ten charges of powder left. Assuming, then,
   his hope of the traders to have been real, he and Du Gay resolved, in
   the mean time, to join a large body of Sioux hunters, who, as Aquipaguetin
   had told them, were on a stream which he calls Bull River, now the Chippeway,
   entering the Mississippi near Lake Pepin. By so doing, they would gain
   a supply of food, and save themselves from the danger of encountering
   parties of roving warriors.</p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg
   273]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">HE REJOINS THE INDIANS.</div>
<p>They found this band, among whom was their companion Accau, and followed
   them on a grand hunt along the borders of the Mississippi. Du Gay was
   separated for a time from Hennepin, who was placed in a canoe with a withered
   squaw more than eighty years old. In spite of her age, she handled her
   paddle with great address, and used it vigorously, as occasion required,
   to repress the gambols of three children, who, to Hennepin's annoyance,
   occupied the middle of the canoe. The hunt was successful. The Sioux warriors,
   active as deer, chased the buffalo on foot with their stone-headed arrows,
   on the plains behind the heights that bordered the river; while the old
   men stood sentinels at the top, watching for the approach of enemies.
   One day an alarm was given. The warriors rushed towards the supposed point
   of danger, but found nothing more formidable than two squaws of their
   own nation, who brought strange news. A war-party of Sioux, they said,
   had gone towards Lake Superior, and had met by the way five "Spirits;" that
   is to say, five Europeans. Hennepin was full of curiosity to learn who
   the strangers might be; and they, on their part, were said to have shown
   great anxiety to know the nationality of the three white men who, as they
   were told, were on the river. The hunt was over; and the hunters, with
   Hennepin and his companion, were on their way northward to their towns,
   when they met the five "Spirits" at some distance below the Falls of St.
   Anthony. They proved to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg
   274]</a></span> be Daniel Greysolon du Lhut, with four well-armed Frenchmen.</p>
<div class="sidenote">DE LHUT'S EXPLORATIONS.</div>
<p>This bold and enterprising man, stigmatized by the Intendant Duchesneau
   as a leader of <i>coureurs de bois</i>, was a cousin of Tonty, born at
   Lyons. He belonged to that caste of the lesser nobles whose name was legion,
   and whose admirable military qualities shone forth so conspicuously in
   the wars of Louis XIV. Though his enterprises were independent of those
   of La Salle, they were at this time carried on in connection with Count
   Frontenac and certain merchants in his interest, of whom Du Lhut's uncle,
   Patron, was one; while Louvigny, his brother-in-law, was in alliance with
   the governor, and was an officer of his guard. Here, then, was a kind
   of family league, countenanced by Frontenac, and acting conjointly with
   him, in order, if the angry letters of the intendant are to be believed,
   to reap a clandestine profit under the shadow of the governor's authority,
   and in violation of the royal ordinances. The rudest part of the work
   fell to the share of Du Lhut, who with a persistent hardihood, not surpassed
   perhaps even by La Salle, was continually in the forest, in the Indian
   towns, or in remote wilderness outposts planted by himself, exploring,
   trading, fighting, ruling lawless savages and whites scarcely less ungovernable,
   and on one or more occasions varying his life by crossing the ocean to
   gain interviews with the colonial minister Seignelay, amid the splendid
   vanities of Versailles. Strange to say, this man of hardy enterprise was
   a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> martyr
   to the gout, which for more than a quarter of a century grievously tormented
   him; though for a time he thought himself cured by the intercession of
   the Iroquois saint, Catharine Tegahkouita, to whom he had made a vow to
   that end. He was, without doubt, an habitual breaker of the royal ordinances
   regulating the fur-trade; yet his services were great to the colony and
   to the crown, and his name deserves a place of honor among the pioneers
   of American civilization.<a name="fnanchor_219" id="fnanchor_219"></a><a href="#footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg
   276]</a></span></p>
<p>When Hennepin met him, he had been about two years in the wilderness.
   In September, 1678, he left Quebec for the purpose of exploring the region
   of the Upper Mississippi, and establishing relations of friendship with
   the Sioux and their kindred the Assiniboins. In the summer of 1679 he
   visited three large towns of the eastern division of the Sioux, including
   those visited by Hennepin in the following year, and planted the King's
   arms in all of them. Early in the autumn he was at the head of Lake Superior,
   holding a council with the Assiniboins and the lake tribes, and inducing
   them to live at peace with the Sioux. In all this, he acted in a public <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg
   277]</a></span> capacity, under the authority of the governor; but it
   is not to be supposed that he forgot his own interests or those of his
   associates. The intendant angrily complains that he aided and abetted
   the <i>coureurs de bois</i> in their lawless courses, and sent down in
   their canoes great quantities of beaver-skins consigned to the merchants
   in league with him, under cover of whose names the governor reaped his
   share of the profits.</p>
<p>In June, 1680, while Hennepin was in the Sioux villages, Du Lhut set out
   from the head of Lake Superior, with two canoes, four Frenchmen, and an
   Indian, to continue his explorations.<a name="fnanchor_220" id="fnanchor_220"></a><a href="#footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> He ascended a river, apparently
   the Burnt Wood, and reached from thence a branch of the Mississippi, which
   seems to have been the St. Croix. It was now that, to his surprise, he
   learned that there were three Europeans on the main river below; and fearing
   that they might be Englishmen or Spaniards encroaching on the territories
   of the King, he eagerly pressed forward to solve his doubts. When he saw
   Hennepin, his mind was set at rest; and the travellers met with mutual
   cordiality. They followed the Indians to their villages of Mille Lac,
   where Hennepin had now no reason to complain of their treatment of him.
   The Sioux gave him and Du Lhut a grand feast of honor, at which were seated
   a hundred and twenty naked guests; and the great chief Ouasicoud&eacute;,
   with his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span> own
   hands, placed before Hennepin a bark dish containing a mess of smoked
   meat and wild rice.</p>
<p>Autumn had come, and the travellers bethought them of going home. The
   Sioux, consoled by their promises to return with goods for trade, did
   not oppose their departure; and they set out together, eight white men
   in all. As they passed St. Anthony's Falls, two of the men stole two buffalo-robes
   which were hung on trees as offerings to the spirit of the cataract. When
   Du Lhut heard of it he was very angry, telling the men that they had endangered
   the lives of the whole party. Hennepin admitted that in the view of human
   prudence he was right, but urged that the act was good and praiseworthy,
   inasmuch as the offerings were made to a false god; while the men, on
   their part, proved mutinous, declaring that they wanted the robes and
   meant to keep them. The travellers continued their journey in great ill-humor,
   but were presently soothed by the excellent hunting which they found on
   the way. As they approached the Wisconsin, they stopped to dry the meat
   of the buffalo they had killed, when to their amazement they saw a war-party
   of Sioux approaching in a fleet of canoes. Hennepin represents himself
   as showing on this occasion an extraordinary courage, going to meet the
   Indians with a peace-pipe, and instructing Du Lhut, who knew more of these
   matters than he, how he ought to behave. The Sioux proved not unfriendly,
   and said nothing of the theft of the buffalo-robes. They soon went on
   their <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> way
   to attack the Illinois and Missouris, leaving the Frenchmen to ascend
   the Wisconsin unmolested.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE RETURN.</div>
<p>After various adventures, they reached the station of the Jesuits at Green
   Bay; but its existence is wholly ignored by Hennepin, whose zeal for his
   own Order will not permit him to allude to this establishment of the rival
   missionaries.<a name="fnanchor_221" id="fnanchor_221"></a><a href="#footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> He is equally reticent with regard to the Jesuit mission
   at Michilimackinac, where the party soon after arrived, and where they
   spent the winter. The only intimation which he gives of its existence
   consists in the mention of the Jesuit Pierson, who was a Fleming like
   himself, and who often skated with him on the frozen lake, or kept him
   company in fishing through a hole in the ice.<a name="fnanchor_222" id="fnanchor_222"></a><a href="#footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> When the spring opened,
   Hennepin descended Lake Huron, followed the Detroit to Lake Erie, and
   proceeded thence to Niagara. Here he spent some time in making a fresh
   examination of the cataract, and then resumed his voyage on Lake Ontario.
   He stopped, however, at the great town of the Senecas, near the Genesee,
   where, with his usual spirit of meddling, he took upon him the functions
   of the civil and military <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg
   280]</a></span> authorities, convoked the chiefs to a council, and urged
   them to set at liberty certain Ottawa prisoners whom they had captured
   in violation of treaties. Having settled this affair to his satisfaction,
   he went to Fort Frontenac, where his brother missionary, Buisset, received
   him with a welcome rendered the warmer by a story which had reached him
   that the Indians had hanged Hennepin with his own cord of St. Francis.</p>
<p>From Fort Frontenac he went to Montreal; and leaving his two men on a
   neighboring island, that they might escape the payment of duties on a
   quantity of furs which they had with them, he paddled alone towards the
   town. Count Frontenac chanced to be here, and, looking from the window
   of a house near the river, he saw approaching in a canoe a R&eacute;collet
   father, whose appearance indicated the extremity of hard service; for
   his face was worn and sunburnt, and his tattered habit of St. Francis
   was abundantly patched with scraps of buffalo-skin. When at length he
   recognized the long-lost Hennepin, he received him, as the father writes, "with
   all the tenderness which a missionary could expect from a person of his
   rank and quality." He kept him for twelve days in his own house, and listened
   with interest to such of his adventures as the friar saw fit to divulge.</p>
<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE'S LETTERS.</div>
<p>And here we bid farewell to Father Hennepin. "Providence," he writes, "preserved
   my life that I might make known my great discoveries to the world." He
   soon after went to Europe, where the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg

   <h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_212" id="footnote_212"></a><a href="#fnanchor_212"> <span class="label">[212]</span></a> The Sioux, or Dacotah, as they call themselves, were a numerous
      people, separated into three great divisions, which were again subdivided
      into bands. Those among whom Hennepin was a prisoner belonged to the
      division known as the Issanti, Issanyati, or, as he writes it, <i>Issati</i>,
      of which the principal band was the Meddewakantonwan. The other great
      divisions, the Yanktons and the Tintonwans, or Tetons, lived west of
      the Mississippi, extending beyond the Missouri, and ranging as far
      as the Rocky Mountains. The Issanti cultivated the soil; but the extreme
      western bands subsisted on the buffalo alone. The former had two kinds
      of dwelling,&mdash;the <i>teepee</i>, or skin-lodge, and the bark-lodge.
      The teepee, which was used by all the Sioux, consists of a covering
      of dressed buffalo-hide, stretched on a conical stack of poles. The
      bark-lodge was peculiar to the Eastern Sioux; and examples of it might
      be seen, until within a few years, among the bands on the St. Peter's.
      In its general character, it was like the Huron and Iroquois houses,
      but was inferior in construction. It had a ridge roof, framed of poles,
      extending from the posts which formed the sides; and the whole was
      covered with elm-bark. The lodges in the villages to which Hennepin
      was conducted were probably of this kind.</p>
   <p>The name Sioux is an abbreviation of <i>Nadouessioux</i>, an Ojibwa
      word, meaning "enemies." The Ojibwas used it to designate this people,
      and occasionally also the Iroquois, being at deadly war with both.</p>
   <p>Rev. Stephen B. Riggs, for many years a missionary among the Issanti
      Sioux, says that this division consists of four distinct bands. They
      ceded all their lands east of the Mississippi to the United States
      in 1837, and lived on the St. Peter's till driven thence in consequence
      of the massacres of 1862, 1863. The Yankton Sioux consist of two bands,
      which are again subdivided. The Assiniboins, or Hohays, are an offshoot
      from the Yanktons, with whom they are now at war. The Tintonwan, or
      Teton Sioux, forming the most western division and the largest, comprise
      seven bands, and are among the bravest and fiercest tenants of the
      prairie.</p>
   <p>The earliest French writers estimate the total number of the Sioux
      at forty thousand; but this is little better than conjecture. Mr. Riggs,
      in 1852, placed it at about twenty-five thousand.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_213" id="footnote_213"></a><a href="#fnanchor_213"> <span class="label">[213]</span></a> These baths consist of a small hut, covered closely with buffalo-skins,
      into which the patient and his friends enter, carefully closing every
      aperture. A pile of heated stones is placed in the middle, and water
      is poured upon them, raising a dense vapor. They are still (1868) in
      use among the Sioux and some other tribes.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_214" id="footnote_214"></a><a href="#fnanchor_214"> <span class="label">[214]</span></a> Hennepin's notice of the falls of St. Anthony, though brief,
      is sufficiently accurate. He says, in his first edition, that they
      are forty or fifty feet high, but adds ten feet more in the edition
      of 1697. In 1821, according to Schoolcraft, the perpendicular fall
      measured forty feet. Great changes, however, have taken place here,
      and are still in progress. The rock is a very soft, friable sandstone,
      overlaid by a stratum of limestone; and it is crumbling with such rapidity
      under the action of the water that the cataract will soon be little
      more than a rapid. Other changes equally disastrous, in an artistic
      point of view, are going on even more quickly. Beside the falls stands
      a city, which, by an ingenious combination of the Greek and Sioux languages,
      has received the name of Minneapolis, or City of the Waters, and which
      in 1867 contained ten thousand inhabitants, two national banks, and
      an opera-house; while its rival city of St. Anthony, immediately opposite,
      boasted a gigantic water-cure and a State university. In short, the
      great natural beauty of the place is utterly spoiled.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_215" id="footnote_215"></a><a href="#fnanchor_215"> <span class="label">[215]</span></a> Oanktayhee, the principal deity of the Sioux, was supposed to
      live under these falls, though he manifested himself in the form of
      a buffalo. It was he who created the earth, like the Algonquin Manabozho,
      from mud brought to him in the paws of a musk-rat. Carver, in 1766,
      saw an Indian throw everything he had about him into the cataract as
      an offering to this deity.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_216" id="footnote_216"></a><a href="#fnanchor_216"> <span class="label">[216]</span></a> In the edition of 1683. In that of 1697 he had grown to seven
      or eight feet. The bank-swallows still make their nests in these cliffs,
      boring easily into the soft sandstone.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_217" id="footnote_217"></a><a href="#fnanchor_217"> <span class="label">[217]</span></a> Hennepin speaks of their size with astonishment, and says that
      the two together would weigh twenty-five pounds. Cat-fish have been
      taken in the Mississippi, weighing more than a hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_218" id="footnote_218"></a><a href="#fnanchor_218"> <span class="label">[218]</span></a> The "Lover's Leap," or "Maiden's Rock" from which a Sioux girl,
      Winona, or the "Eldest Born," is said to have thrown herself, in the
      despair of disappointed affection. The story, which seems founded in
      truth, will be found, not without embellishments, in Mrs. Eastman's <i>Legends
      of the Sioux</i>.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_219" id="footnote_219"></a><a href="#fnanchor_219"> <span class="label">[219]</span></a> The facts concerning Du Lhut have been gleaned from a variety
      of contemporary documents, chiefly the letters of his enemy Duchesneau,
      who always puts him in the worst light, especially in his despatch
      to Seignelay of 10 Nov., 1679, where he charges both him and the governor
      with carrying on an illicit trade with the English of New York. Du
      Lhut himself, in a memoir dated 1685 (see Harrisse, <i>Bibliographie</i>,
      176), strongly denies these charges. Du Lhut built a trading fort on
      Lake Superior, called Cananistigoyan (La Hontan), or Kamalastigouia
      (Perrot). It was on the north side, at the mouth of a river entering
      Thunder Bay, where Fort William now stands. In 1684 he caused two Indians,
      who had murdered several Frenchmen on Lake Superior, to be shot. He
      displayed in this affair great courage and coolness, undaunted by the
      crowd of excited savages who surrounded him and his little band of
      Frenchmen. The long letter, in which he recounts the capture and execution
      of the murderers, is before me. Duchesneau makes his conduct on this
      occasion the ground of a charge of rashness. In 1686 Denonville, then
      governor of the colony, ordered him to fortify the Detroit; that is,
      the strait between Lakes Erie and Huron. He went thither with fifty
      men and built a palisade fort, which he occupied for some time. In
      1687 he, together with Tonty and Durantaye, joined Denonville against
      the Senecas, with a body of Indians from the Upper Lakes. In 1689,
      during the panic that followed the Iroquois invasion of Montreal, Du
      Lhut, with twenty-eight Canadians, attacked twenty-two Iroquois in
      canoes, received their fire without returning it, bore down upon them,
      killed eighteen of them, and captured three, only one escaping. In
      1695 he was in command at Fort Frontenac. In 1697 he succeeded to the
      command of a company of infantry, but was suffering wretchedly from
      the gout at Fort Frontenac. In 1710 Vaudreuil, in a despatch to the
      minister Ponchartrain, announced his death as occurring in the previous
      winter, and added the brief comment, "c'&eacute;tait un tr&egrave;s-honn&ecirc;te
      homme." Other contemporaries speak to the same effect. "M<sup>r.</sup> Dulhut,
      Gentilhomme Lionnois, qui a beaucoup de m&eacute;rite et de capacit&eacute;."&mdash;<i>La
      Hontan</i>, i. 103 (1703). "Le Sieur du Lut, homme d'esprit et d'exp&eacute;rience."&mdash;<i>Le
      Clerc</i>, ii. 137. Charlevoix calls him "one of the bravest officers
      the King has ever had in this colony." His name is variously spelled
      Du Luc, Du Lud, Du Lude, Du Lut, Du Luth, Du Lhut. For an account of
      the Iroquois virgin, Tegahkouita, whose intercession is said to have
      cured him of the gout, see Charlevoix, i. 572.</p>
   <p>On a contemporary manuscript map by the Jesuit Raffeix, representing
      the routes of Marquette, La Salle, and Du Lhut, are the following words,
      referring to the last-named discoverer, and interesting in connection
      with Hennepin's statements: "M<sup>r.</sup> du Lude le premier a est&eacute; chez
      les Sioux en 1678, et a est&eacute; proche la source du Mississippi,
      et ensuite vint retirer le P. Louis [<i>Hennepin</i>] qui avoit est&eacute; fait
      prisonnier chez les Sioux." Du Lhut here appears as the deliverer of
      Hennepin. One of his men was named Pepin; hence, no doubt, the name
      of Lake Pepin.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_220" id="footnote_220"></a><a href="#fnanchor_220"> <span class="label">[220]</span></a> <i>Memoir on the French Dominion in Canada, N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>,

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_221" id="footnote_221"></a><a href="#fnanchor_221"> <span class="label">[221]</span></a> On the other hand, he sets down on his map of 1683 a mission
      of the R&eacute;collets at a point north of the farthest sources of
      the Mississippi, to which no white man had ever penetrated.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_222" id="footnote_222"></a><a href="#fnanchor_222"> <span class="label">[222]</span></a> He says that Pierson had come among the Indians to learn their
      language; that he "retained the frankness and rectitude of our country" and "a
      disposition always on the side of candor and sincerity. In a word,
      he seemed to me to be all that a Christian ought to be" (1697), 433.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_223" id="footnote_223"></a><a href="#fnanchor_223"> <span class="label">[223]</span></a> Since the two preceding chapters were written, the letters of
      La Salle have been brought to light by the researches of M. Margry.
      They confirm, in nearly all points, the conclusions given above; though,
      as before observed (<i>note</i>, 186), they show misstatements on the
      part of Hennepin concerning his position at the outset of the expedition.
      La Salle writes: "J'ay fait remonter le fleuve Colbert, nomm&eacute; par
      les Iroquois Gastacha, par les Outaouais Mississipy par un canot conduit
      par deux de mes gens, l'un nomm&eacute; Michel Accault et l'autre Picard,
      auxquels le R. P. Hennepin se joignit pour ne perdre pas l'occasion
      de prescher l'&Eacute;vangile aux peuples qui habitent dessus et qui
      n'en avoient jamais oui parler." In the same letter he recounts their
      voyage on the Upper Mississippi, and their capture by the Sioux in
      accordance with the story of Hennepin himself. Hennepin's assertion,
      that La Salle had promised to send a number of men to meet him at the
      mouth of the Wisconsin, turns out to be true. "Estans tous revenus
      en chasse avec les Nadouessioux [<i>Sioux</i>] vers Ouisconsing [<i>Wisconsin</i>],
      le R. P. Louis Hempin [<i>Hennepin</i>] et Picard prirent r&eacute;solution
      de venir jusqu'&agrave; l'emboucheure de la rivi&egrave;re o&ugrave; j'avois
      promis d'envoyer de mes nouvelles, comme j'avois fait par six hommes
      que les J&eacute;suistes desbauch&egrave;rent en leur disant que le
      R. P. Louis et ses compagnons de voyage avoient est&eacute; tuez."</p>
   <p>It is clear that La Salle understood Hennepin; for, after speaking
      of his journey, he adds: "J'ai cru qu'il estoit &agrave; propos de
      vous faire le narr&eacute; des aventures de ce canot parce que je ne
      doute pas qu'on en parle; et si vous souhaitez en conf&eacute;rer avec
      le P. Louis Hempin, R&eacute;collect, qui est repass&eacute; en France,
      il faut un peu le connoistre, car il ne manquera pas d'exag&eacute;rer
      toutes choses, c'est son caract&egrave;re, et &agrave; moy mesme il
      m'a escrit comme s'il eust est&eacute; tout pr&egrave;s d'estre brusl&eacute;,
      quoiqu'il n'en ait pas est&eacute; seulement en danger; mais il croit
      qu'il luy est honorable de le faire de la sorte, et <i>il parle plus
      conform&eacute;ment &agrave; ce qu'il veut qu'&agrave; ce qu'il scait</i>."&mdash;<i>Lettre
      de la Salle, 22 Ao&ucirc;t, 1682</i> (1681?), Margry, ii. 259.</p>
   <p>On his return to France, Hennepin got hold of the manuscript, <i>Relation
         des D&eacute;couvertes</i>, compiled for the government from La
         Salle's letters, and, as already observed, made very free use of
         it in the first edition of his book, printed in 1683. In 1699 he
         wished to return to Canada; but, in a letter of that year, Louis
         XIV. orders the governor <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg
         282]</a></span> to seize him, should he appear, and send
         him prisoner to Rochefort. This seems to have been in consequence
         of his renouncing the service of the French crown, and dedicating
         his edition of 1697 to William III. of England.</p>
   <p>More than twenty editions of Hennepin's travels appeared, in French,
      English, Dutch, German, Italian, and Spanish. Most of them include
      the mendacious narrative of the pretended descent of the Mississippi.
      For a list of them, see <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, i. 346; ii. 24.</p>

<p class="center">LA SALLE BEGINS ANEW.</p>
<div class="smcap" style="padding-left:1.5em; text-indent:-1.5em">His Constancy; his Plans;
his Savage Allies; he becomes Snow-blind.&mdash;Negotiations.&mdash;Grand
Council.&mdash;La Salle's Oratory.&mdash;Meeting with Tonty.&mdash;Preparation.&mdash;Departure.</div>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> tracing the adventures of Tonty and the rovings of Hennepin, we have
   lost sight of La Salle, the pivot of the enterprise. Returning from the
   desolation and horror in the valley of the Illinois, he had spent the
   winter at Fort Miami, on the St. Joseph, by the borders of Lake Michigan.
   Here he might have brooded on the redoubled ruin that had befallen him,&mdash;the
   desponding friends, the exulting foes; the wasted energies, the crushing
   load of debt, the stormy past, the black and lowering future. But his
   mind was of a different temper. He had no thought but to grapple with
   adversity, and out of the fragments of his ruin to build up the fabric
   of success.</p>
<p>He would not recoil; but he modified his plans to meet the new contingency.
   His white enemies had found, or rather perhaps had made, a savage ally
   in the Iroquois. Their incursions must be stopped, or <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg
   284]</a></span> his enterprise would come to nought; and he thought he
   saw the means by which this new danger could be converted into a source
   of strength. The tribes of the West, threatened by the common enemy, might
   be taught to forget their mutual animosities and join in a defensive league,
   with La Salle at its head. They might be colonized around his fort in
   the valley of the Illinois, where in the shadow of the French flag, and
   with the aid of French allies, they could hold the Iroquois in check,
   and acquire in some measure the arts of a settled life. The Franciscan
   friars could teach them the Faith; and La Salle and his associates could
   supply them with goods, in exchange for the vast harvest of furs which
   their hunters could gather in these boundless wilds. Meanwhile, he would
   seek out the mouth of the Mississippi; and the furs gathered at his colony
   in the Illinois would then find a ready passage to the markets of the
   world. Thus might this ancient slaughter-field of warring savages be redeemed
   to civilization and Christianity; and a stable settlement, half-feudal,
   half-commercial, grow up in the heart of the western wilderness. This
   plan was but a part of the original scheme of his enterprise, adapted
   to new and unexpected circumstances; and he now set himself to its execution
   with his usual vigor, joined to an address which, when dealing with Indians,
   never failed him.</p>
<div class="sidenote">INDIAN FRIENDS.</div>
<p>There were allies close at hand. Near Fort Miami were the huts of twenty-five
   or thirty savages, exiles <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg
   285]</a></span> from their homes, and strangers in this western world.
   Several of the English colonies, from Virginia to Maine, had of late years
   been harassed by Indian wars; and the Puritans of New England, above all,
   had been scourged by the deadly outbreak of King Philip's war. Those engaged
   in it had paid a bitter price for their brief triumphs. A band of refugees,
   chiefly Abenakis and Mohegans, driven from their native seats, had roamed
   into these distant wilds, and were wintering in the friendly neighborhood
   of the French. La Salle soon won them over to his interests. One of their
   number was the Mohegan hunter, who for two years had faithfully followed
   his fortunes, and who had been four years in the West. He is described
   as a prudent and discreet young man, in whom La Salle had great confidence,
   and who could make himself understood in several western languages, belonging,
   like his own, to the great Algonquin tongue. This devoted henchman proved
   an efficient mediator with his countrymen. The New-England Indians, with
   one voice, promised to follow La Salle, asking no recompense but to call
   him their chief, and yield to him the love and admiration which he rarely
   failed to command from this hero-worshipping race.</p>
<p>New allies soon appeared. A Shawanoe chief from the valley of the Ohio,
   whose following embraced a hundred and fifty warriors, came to ask the
   protection of the French against the all-destroying Iroquois. "The Shawanoes
   are too distant," was La Salle's <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg
   286]</a></span> reply; "but let them come to me at the Illinois, and they
   shall be safe." The chief promised to join him in the autumn, at Fort
   Miami, with all his band. But, more important than all, the consent and
   co-operation of the Illinois must be gained; and the Miamis, their neighbors
   and of late their enemies, must be taught the folly of their league with
   the Iroquois, and the necessity of joining in the new confederation. Of
   late, they had been made to see the perfidy of their dangerous allies.
   A band of the Iroquois, returning from the slaughter of the Tamaroa Illinois,
   had met and murdered a band of Miamis on the Ohio, and had not only refused
   satisfaction, but had intrenched themselves in three rude forts of trees
   and brushwood in the heart of the Miami country. The moment was favorable
   for negotiating; but, first, La Salle wished to open a communication with
   the Illinois, some of whom had begun to return to the country they had
   abandoned. With this view, and also, it seems, to procure provisions,
   he set out on the first of March, with his lieutenant La Forest, and fifteen
   men.</p>
<p>The country was sheeted in snow, and the party journeyed on snow-shoes;
   but when they reached the open prairies, the white expanse glared in the
   sun with so dazzling a brightness that La Salle and several of the men
   became snow-blind. They stopped and encamped under the edge of a forest;
   and here La Salle remained in darkness for three days, suffering extreme
   pain. Meanwhile, he sent forward La <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg
   287]</a></span> Forest and most of the men, keeping with him his old attendant
   Hunaut. Going out in quest of pine-leaves,&mdash;a decoction of which
   was supposed to be useful in cases of snow-blindness,&mdash;this man discovered
   the fresh tracks of Indians, followed them, and found a camp of Outagamies,
   or Foxes, from the neighborhood of Green Bay. From them he heard welcome
   news. They told him that Tonty was safe among the Pottawattamies, and
   that Hennepin had passed through their country on his return from among
   the Sioux.<a name="fnanchor_224" id="fnanchor_224"></a><a href="#footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">ILLINOIS ALLIES.</div>
<p>A thaw took place; the snow melted rapidly; the rivers were opened; the
   blind men began to recover; and launching the canoes which they had dragged
   after them, the party pursued their way by water. They soon met a band
   of Illinois. La Salle gave them presents, condoled with them on their
   losses, and urged them to make peace and alliance with the Miamis. Thus,
   he said, they could set the Iroquois at defiance; for he himself, with
   his Frenchmen and his Indian friends, would make his abode among them,
   supply them with goods, and aid them to defend themselves. They listened,
   well pleased, promised to carry his message to their countrymen, and furnished
   him with a large supply of corn.<a name="fnanchor_225" id="fnanchor_225"></a><a href="#footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Meanwhile he had rejoined La Forest,
   whom he now <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg
   288]</a></span> sent to Michilimackinac to await Tonty, and tell him to
   remain there till he, La Salle, should arrive.</p>
<p>Having thus accomplished the objects of his journey, he returned to Fort
   Miami, whence he soon after ascended the St. Joseph to the village of
   the Miami Indians, on the portage, at the head of the Kankakee. Here he
   found unwelcome guests. These were three Iroquois warriors, who had been
   for some time in the place, and who, as he was told, had demeaned themselves
   with the insolence of conquerors, and spoken of the French with the utmost
   contempt. He hastened to confront them, rebuked and menaced them, and
   told them that now, when he was present, they dared not repeat the calumnies
   which they had uttered in his absence. They stood abashed and confounded,
   and during the following night secretly left the town and fled. The effect
   was prodigious on the minds of the Miamis, when they saw that La Salle,
   backed by ten Frenchmen, could command from their arrogant visitors a
   respect which they, with their hundreds of warriors, had wholly failed
   to inspire. Here, at the outset, was an augury full of promise for the
   approaching negotiations.</p>
<p>There were other strangers in the town,&mdash;a band of eastern Indians,
   more numerous than those who had wintered at the fort. The greater number
   were from Rhode Island, including, probably, some of King Philip's warriors;
   others were from New York, and others again from Virginia. La Salle called <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg
   289]</a></span> them to a council, promised them a new home in the West
   under the protection of the Great King, with rich lands, an abundance
   of game, and French traders to supply them with the goods which they had
   once received from the English. Let them but help him to make peace between
   the Miamis and the Illinois, and he would insure for them a future of
   prosperity and safety. They listened with open ears, and promised their
   aid in the work of peace.</p>
<div class="sidenote">GRAND COUNCIL.</div>
<p>On the next morning, the Miamis were called to a grand council. It was
   held in the lodge of their chief, from which the mats were removed, that
   the crowd without might hear what was said. La Salle rose and harangued
   the concourse. Few men were so skilled in the arts of forest rhetoric
   and diplomacy. After the Indian mode, he was, to follow his chroniclers, "the
   greatest orator in North America."<a name="fnanchor_226" id="fnanchor_226"></a><a href="#footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> He began with a gift of tobacco,
   to clear the brains of his auditory; next, for he had brought a canoe-load
   of presents to support his eloquence, he gave them cloth to cover their
   dead, coats to dress them, hatchets to build a grand scaffold in their
   honor, and beads, bells, and trinkets of all sorts, to decorate their
   relatives at a grand funeral feast. All this was mere metaphor. The living,
   while appropriating the gifts to their own use, were pleased at the compliment
   offered to their dead; and their delight redoubled as the orator proceeded.
   One of their <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg
   290]</a></span> great chiefs had lately been killed; and La Salle, after
   a eulogy of the departed, declared that he would now raise him to life
   again; that is, that he would assume his name and give support to his
   squaws and children. This flattering announcement drew forth an outburst
   of applause; and when, to confirm his words, his attendants placed before
   them a huge pile of coats, shirts, and hunting-knives, the whole assembly
   exploded in yelps of admiration.</p>
<p>Now came the climax of the harangue, introduced by a further present of
   six guns:&mdash;</p>
<p>"He who is my master, and the master of all this country, is a mighty
   chief, feared by the whole world; but he loves peace, and the words of
   his lips are for good alone. He is called the King of France, and he is
   the mightiest among the chiefs beyond the great water. His goodness reaches
   even to your dead, and his subjects come among you to raise them up to
   life. But it is his will to preserve the life he has given; it is his
   will that you should obey his laws, and make no war without the leave
   of Onontio, who commands in his name at Quebec, and who loves all the
   nations alike, because such is the will of the Great King. You ought,
   then, to live at peace with your neighbors, and above all with the Illinois.
   You have had causes of quarrel with them; but their defeat has avenged
   you. Though they are still strong, they wish to make peace with you. Be
   content with the glory of having obliged them to ask for it. You have
   an interest in preserving them; since, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg
   291]</a></span> if the Iroquois destroy them, they will next destroy you.
   Let us all obey the Great King, and live together in peace, under his
   protection. Be of my mind, and use these guns that I have given you, not
   to make war, but only to hunt and to defend yourselves."<a name="fnanchor_227" id="fnanchor_227"></a><a href="#footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">THE CHIEFS REPLY.</div>
<p>So saying, he gave two belts of wampum to confirm his words; and the assembly
   dissolved. On the following day, the chiefs again convoked it, and made
   their reply in form. It was all that La Salle could have wished. "The
   Illinois is our brother, because he is the son of our Father, the Great
   King." "We make you the master of our beaver and our lands, of our minds
   and our bodies." "We cannot wonder that our brothers from the East wish
   to live with you. We should have wished so too, if we had known what a
   blessing it is to be the children of the Great King." The rest of this
   auspicious day was passed in feasts and dances, in which La Salle and
   his Frenchmen all bore part. His new scheme was hopefully begun. It remained
   to achieve the enterprise, twice defeated, of the discovery of the mouth
   of the Mississippi,&mdash;that vital condition of his triumph, without
   which all other success was meaningless and vain.</p>
<p>To this end he must return to Canada, appease his creditors, and collect
   his scattered resources. Towards the end of May he set out in canoes from <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg
   292]</a></span> Fort Miami, and reached Michilimackinac after a prosperous
   voyage. Here, to his great joy, he found Tonty and Zenobe Membr&eacute;,
   who had lately arrived from Green Bay. The meeting was one at which even
   his stoic nature must have melted. Each had for the other a tale of disaster;
   but when La Salle recounted the long succession of his reverses, it was
   with the tranquil tone and cheerful look of one who relates the incidents
   of an ordinary journey. Membr&eacute; looked on him with admiration. "Any
   one else," he says, "would have thrown up his hand and abandoned the enterprise;
   but, far from this, with a firmness and constancy that never had its equal,
   I saw him more resolved than ever to continue his work and push forward
   his discovery."<a name="fnanchor_228" id="fnanchor_228"></a><a href="#footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>
<p>Without loss of time they embarked together for Fort Frontenac, paddled
   their canoes a thousand miles, and safely reached their destination. Here,
   in this third beginning of his enterprise, La Salle found himself beset
   with embarrassments. Not only was he burdened with the fruitless costs
   of his two former efforts, but the heavy debts which he had incurred in
   building and maintaining Fort Frontenac had not been wholly paid. The
   fort and the seigniory were already deeply mortgaged; yet through the
   influence of Count Frontenac, the assistance of his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg
   293]</a></span> secretary Barrois, a consummate man of business, and the
   support of a wealthy relative, he found means to appease his creditors
   and even to gain fresh advances. To this end, however, he was forced to
   part with a portion of his monopolies. Having first made his will at Montreal,
   in favor of a cousin who had befriended him,<a name="fnanchor_229" id="fnanchor_229"></a><a href="#footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> he mustered his men,
   and once more set forth, resolved to trust no more to agents, but to lead
   on his followers, in a united body, under his own personal command.<a name="fnanchor_230" id="fnanchor_230"></a><a href="#footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">THE TORONTO PORTAGE.</div>
<p>At the beginning of autumn he was at Toronto, where the long and difficult
   portage to Lake Simcoe detained him a fortnight. He spent a part of it
   in writing an account of what had lately occurred to a correspondent in
   France, and he closes his letter thus: "This is all I can tell you this
   year. I have a hundred things to write, but you could not believe how
   hard it is to do it among Indians. The canoes and their lading must be
   got over the portage, and I must speak to them continually and bear all
   their importunity, or else they will do nothing I want. I hope to write
   more at leisure next year, and tell you <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg
   294]</a></span> the end of this business, which I hope will turn out well:
   for I have M. de Tonty, who is full of zeal; thirty Frenchmen, all good
   men, without reckoning such as I cannot trust; and more than a hundred
   Indians, some of them Shawanoes, and others from New England, all of whom
   know how to use guns."</p>
<p>It was October before he reached Lake Huron. Day after day and week after
   week the heavy-laden canoes crept on along the lonely wilderness shores,
   by the monotonous ranks of bristling moss-bearded firs; lake and forest,
   forest and lake; a dreary scene haunted with yet more dreary memories,&mdash;disasters,
   sorrows, and deferred hopes; time, strength, and wealth spent in vain;
   a ruinous past and a doubtful future; slander, obloquy, and hate. With
   unmoved heart, the patient voyager held his course, and drew up his canoes
   at last on the beach at Fort Miami.</p>

<div class="smcap" style="padding-left:1.5em; text-indent:-1.5em">His Followers.&mdash;The

Mouth of the Mississippi.&mdash;Louis XIV. proclaimed
Sovereign of the Great West.</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> season was far advanced. On the bare limbs of the forest hung a few
   withered remnants of its gay autumnal livery; and the smoke crept upward
   through the sullen November air from the squalid wigwams of La Salle's
   Abenaki and Mohegan allies. These, his new friends, were savages whose
   midnight yells had startled the border hamlets of New England; who had
   danced around Puritan scalps, and whom Puritan imaginations painted as
   incarnate fiends. La Salle chose eighteen of them, whom he added to the
   twenty-three Frenchmen who remained with him, some of the rest having
   deserted and others lagged behind. The Indians insisted on taking their
   squaws with them. These were ten in number, besides three children; and
   thus the expedition included fifty-four persons, of whom some were useless,
   and others a burden.</p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg
   296]</a></span></p>
<p>On the 21st of December, Tonty and Membr&eacute; set out from Fort Miami
   with some of the party in six canoes, and crossed to the little river
   Chicago.<a name="fnanchor_231" id="fnanchor_231"></a><a href="#footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> La Salle, with the rest of the men, joined them a few days
   later. It was the dead of winter, and the streams were frozen. They made
   sledges, placed on them the canoes, the baggage, and a disabled Frenchman;
   crossed from the Chicago to the northern branch of the Illinois, and filed
   in a long procession down its frozen course. They reached the site of
   the great Illinois village, found it tenantless, and continued their journey,
   still dragging their canoes, till at length they reached open water below
   Lake Peoria.</p>
<div class="sidenote">PRUDHOMME.</div>
<p>La Salle had abandoned for a time his original plan of building a vessel
   for the navigation of the Mississippi. Bitter experience had taught him
   the difficulty of the attempt, and he resolved to trust to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg
   297]</a></span> his canoes alone. They embarked again, floating prosperously
   down between the leafless forests that flanked the tranquil river; till,
   on the sixth of February, they issued upon the majestic bosom of the Mississippi.
   Here, for the time, their progress was stopped; for the river was full
   of floating ice. La Salle's Indians, too, had lagged behind; but within
   a week all had arrived, the navigation was once more free, and they resumed
   their course. Towards evening they saw on their right the mouth of a great
   river; and the clear current was invaded by the headlong torrent of the
   Missouri, opaque with mud. They built their camp-fires in the neighboring
   forest; and at daylight, embarking anew on the dark and mighty stream,
   drifted swiftly down towards unknown destinies. They passed a deserted
   town of the Tamaroas; saw, three days after, the mouth of the Ohio;<a name="fnanchor_232" id="fnanchor_232"></a><a href="#footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
   and, gliding by the wastes of bordering swamp, landed on the twenty-fourth
   of February near the Third Chickasaw Bluffs.<a name="fnanchor_233" id="fnanchor_233"></a><a href="#footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> They encamped, and the
   hunters went out for game. All returned, excepting Pierre Prudhomme; and
   as the others had seen fresh tracks of Indians, La Salle feared that he
   was killed. While some of his followers built a small stockade fort on
   a high bluff<a name="fnanchor_234" id="fnanchor_234"></a><a href="#footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> by the river, others <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg
   298]</a></span> ranged the woods in pursuit of the missing hunter. After
   six days of ceaseless and fruitless search, they met two Chickasaw Indians
   in the forest; and through them La Salle sent presents and peace-messages
   to that warlike people, whose villages were a few days' journey distant.
   Several days later Prudhomme was found, and brought into the camp, half-dead.
   He had lost his way while hunting; and to console him for his woes La
   Salle christened the newly built fort with his name, and left him, with
   a few others, in charge of it.</p>
<p>Again they embarked; and with every stage of their adventurous progress
   the mystery of this vast New World was more and more unveiled. More and
   more they entered the realms of spring. The hazy sunlight, the warm and
   drowsy air, the tender foliage, the opening flowers, betokened the reviving
   life of Nature. For several days more they followed the writhings of the
   great river on its tortuous course through wastes of swamp and cane-brake,
   till on the thirteenth of March<a name="fnanchor_235" id="fnanchor_235"></a><a href="#footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> they found themselves wrapped in
   a thick fog. Neither shore was visible; but they heard on the right the
   booming of an Indian drum and the shrill outcries of the war-dance. La
   Salle at once crossed to the opposite side, where, in less than an hour,
   his men threw up a rude fort of felled trees. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg
   299]</a></span> Meanwhile the fog cleared; and from the farther bank the
   astonished Indians saw the strange visitors at their work. Some of the
   French advanced to the edge of the water, and beckoned them to come over.
   Several of them approached, in a wooden canoe, to within the distance
   of a gun-shot. La Salle displayed the calumet, and sent a Frenchman to
   meet them. He was well received; and the friendly mood of the Indians
   being now apparent, the whole party crossed the river.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE ARKANSAS.</div>
<p>On landing, they found themselves at a town of the Kappa band of the Arkansas,
   a people dwelling near the mouth of the river which bears their name. "The
   whole village," writes Membr&eacute; to his superior, "came down to the
   shore to meet us, except the women, who had run off. I cannot tell you
   the civility and kindness we received from these barbarians, who brought
   us poles to make huts, supplied us with firewood during the three days
   we were among them, and took turns in feasting us. But, my Reverend Father,
   this gives no idea of the good qualities of these savages, who are gay,
   civil, and free-hearted. The young men, though the most alert and spirited
   we had seen, are nevertheless so modest that not one of them would take
   the liberty to enter our hut, but all stood quietly at the door. They
   are so well formed that we were in admiration at their beauty. We did
   not lose the value of a pin while we were among them."</p>
<p>Various were the dances and ceremonies with which <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg
         300]</a></span> they entertained the strangers, who, on their part,
         responded with a solemnity which their hosts would have liked less
         if they had understood it better. La Salle and Tonty, at the head
         of their followers, marched to the open area in the midst of the
         village. Here, to the admiration of the gazing crowd of warriors,
         women, and children, a cross was raised bearing the arms of France.
         Membr&eacute;, in canonicals, sang a hymn; the men shouted <i>Vive
         le Roi</i>; and La Salle, in the King's name, took formal possession
         of the country.<a name="fnanchor_236" id="fnanchor_236"></a><a href="#footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> The friar, not, he flatters himself, without
         success, labored to expound by signs the mysteries of the Faith;
         while La Salle, by methods equally satisfactory, drew from the chief
         an acknowledgement of fealty to Louis XIV.<a name="fnanchor_237" id="fnanchor_237"></a><a href="#footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">THE TAENSAS.</div>
<p>After touching at several other towns of this people, the voyagers resumed
   their course, guided by two of the Arkansas; passed the sites, since become
   historic, of Vicksburg and Grand Gulf; and, about three hundred miles
   below the Arkansas, stopped by the edge of a swamp on the western side
   of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span> river.<a name="fnanchor_238" id="fnanchor_238"></a><a href="#footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
   Here, as their two guides told them, was the path to the great town of
   the Taensas. Tonty and Membr&eacute; were sent to visit it. They and their
   men shouldered their birch canoe through the swamp, and launched it on
   a lake which had once formed a portion of the channel of the river. In
   two hours, they reached the town; and Tonty gazed at it with astonishment.
   He had seen nothing like it in America,&mdash;large square dwellings,
   built of sun-baked mud mixed with straw, arched over with a dome-shaped
   roof of canes, and placed in regular order around an open area. Two of
   them were larger and better than the rest. One was the lodge of the chief;
   the other was the temple, or house of the Sun. They entered the former,
   and found a single room, forty feet square, where, in the dim light,&mdash;for
   there was no opening but the door,&mdash;the chief sat awaiting them on
   a sort of bedstead, three of his wives at his side; while sixty old men,
   wrapped in white cloaks woven of mulberry-bark, formed his divan. When
   he spoke, his wives howled to do him honor; and the assembled councillors
   listened with the reverence due to a potentate for whom, at his death,
   a hundred victims were to be sacrificed. He received the visitors graciously,
   and joyfully <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg
   302]</a></span> accepted the gifts which Tonty laid before him.<a name="fnanchor_239" id="fnanchor_239"></a><a href="#footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> This
   interview over, the Frenchmen repaired to the temple, wherein were kept
   the bones of the departed chiefs. In construction, it was much like the
   royal dwelling. Over it were rude wooden figures, representing three eagles
   turned towards the east. A strong mud wall surrounded it, planted with
   stakes, on which were stuck the skulls of enemies sacrificed to the Sun;
   while before the door was a block of wood, on which lay a large shell
   surrounded with the braided hair of the victims. The interior was rude
   as a barn, dimly lighted from the doorway, and full of smoke. There was
   a structure in the middle which Membr&eacute; thinks was a kind of altar;
   and before it burned a perpetual fire, fed with three logs laid end to
   end, and watched by two old men devoted to this sacred office. There was
   a mysterious recess, too, which the strangers were forbidden to explore,
   but which, as Tonty was told, contained the riches of the nation, consisting
   of pearls from the Gulf, and trinkets obtained, probably through other
   tribes, from the Spaniards and other Europeans.</p>
<p>The chief condescended to visit La Salle at his camp,&mdash;a favor which
   he would by no means have granted, had the visitors been Indians. A master
   of ceremonies and six attendants preceded him, to clear <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg
   303]</a></span> the path and prepare the place of meeting. When all was
   ready, he was seen advancing, clothed in a white robe and preceded by
   two men bearing white fans, while a third displayed a disk of burnished
   copper,&mdash;doubtless to represent the Sun, his ancestor, or, as others
   will have it, his elder brother. His aspect was marvellously grave, and
   he and La Salle met with gestures of ceremonious courtesy. The interview
   was very friendly; and the chief returned well pleased with the gifts
   which his entertainer bestowed on him, and which, indeed, had been the
   principal motive of his visit.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE NATCHEZ.</div>
<p>On the next morning, as they descended the river, they saw a wooden canoe
   full of Indians; and Tonty gave chase. He had nearly overtaken it, when
   more than a hundred men appeared suddenly on the shore, with bows bent
   to defend their countrymen. La Salle called out to Tonty to withdraw.
   He obeyed; and the whole party encamped on the opposite bank. Tonty offered
   to cross the river with a peace-pipe, and set out accordingly with a small
   party of men. When he landed, the Indians made signs of friendship by
   joining their hands,&mdash;a proceeding by which Tonty, having but one
   hand, was somewhat embarrassed; but he directed his men to respond in
   his stead. La Salle and Membr&eacute; now joined him, and went with the
   Indians to their village, three leagues distant. Here they spent the night. "The
   Sieur de la Salle," writes Membr&eacute;, "whose very air, engaging manners,
   tact, and address attract love and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg
   304]</a></span> respect alike, produced such an effect on the hearts of
   these people that they did not know how to treat us well enough."<a name="fnanchor_240" id="fnanchor_240"></a><a href="#footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>
<p>The Indians of this village were the Natchez; and their chief was brother
   of the great chief, or Sun, of the whole nation. His town was several
   leagues distant, near the site of the city of Natchez; and thither the
   French repaired to visit him. They saw what they had already seen among
   the Taensas,&mdash;a religious and political despotism, a privileged caste
   descended from the sun, a temple, and a sacred fire.<a name="fnanchor_241" id="fnanchor_241"></a><a href="#footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg
   305]</a></span> La Salle planted a large cross, with the arms of France
   attached, in the midst of the town; while the inhabitants looked on with
   a satisfaction which they would hardly have displayed had they understood
   the meaning of the act.</p>
<div class="sidenote">HOSTILITY.</div>
<p>The French next visited the Coroas, at their village two leagues below;
   and here they found a reception no less auspicious. On the thirty-first
   of March, as they approached Red River, they passed in the fog a town
   of the Oumas, and three days later discovered a party of fishermen, in
   wooden canoes, among the canes along the margin of the water. They fled
   at sight of the Frenchmen. La Salle sent men to reconnoitre, who, as they
   struggled through the marsh, were greeted with a shower of arrows; while
   from the neighboring village of the Quinipissas,<a name="fnanchor_242" id="fnanchor_242"></a><a href="#footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> invisible behind
   the cane-brake, they heard the sound of an Indian drum and the whoops
   of the mustering warriors. La Salle, anxious to keep the peace with all
   the tribes along the river, recalled his men, and pursued his voyage.
   A few leagues below they saw a cluster of Indian lodges on the left bank,
   apparently void of inhabitants. They landed, and found three of them filled
   with corpses. It was a village of the Tangibao, sacked by their enemies
   only a few days before.<a name="fnanchor_243" id="fnanchor_243"></a><a href="#footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg
   306]</a></span></p>
<p>And now they neared their journey's end. On the sixth of April the river
   divided itself into three broad channels. La Salle followed that of the
   west, and Dautray that of the east; while Tonty took the middle passage.
   As he drifted down the turbid current, between the low and marshy shores,
   the brackish water changed to brine, and the breeze grew fresh with the
   salt breath of the sea. Then the broad bosom of the great Gulf opened
   on his sight, tossing its restless billows, limitless, voiceless, lonely
   as when born of chaos, without a sail, without a sign of life.</p>
<p>La Salle, in a canoe, coasted the marshy borders of the sea; and then
   the reunited parties assembled on a spot of dry ground, a short distance
   above the mouth of the river. Here a column was made ready, bearing the
   arms of France, and inscribed with the words, "<span class="smcap">Louis
   Le Grand, Roy De France Et De Navarre, R&egrave;gne; Le Neuvi&egrave;me
   Avril, 1682</span>."</p>
<p>The Frenchmen were mustered under arms; and while the New England Indians
   and their squaws looked on in wondering silence, they chanted the <i>Te
   Deum</i>, the <i>Exaudiat</i>, and the <i>Domine salvum fac Regem</i>.
   Then, amid volleys of musketry and shouts of <i>Vive le Roi</i>, La Salle
   planted the column in its place, and, standing near it, proclaimed in
   a loud voice,&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote">POSSESSION TAKEN.</div>
<p>"In the name of the most high, mighty, invincible, and victorious Prince,
   Louis the Great, by the grace of God King of France and of Navarre, Fourteenth
   of that name, I, this ninth day of April, one thousand six hundred and
   eighty-two, in virtue of the commission <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg

   be seen by all whom it may concern, have taken, and do now take, in the

   this country of Louisiana, the seas, harbors, ports, bays, adjacent straits,
   and all the nations, peoples, provinces, cities, towns, villages, mines,

   protesting against all who may hereafter undertake to invade any or all
   of these aforesaid countries, peoples, or lands, to the prejudice of the
   rights of his Majesty, acquired by the consent of the nations dwelling
   herein. Of which, and of all else that is needful, I hereby take to witness

<p>Shouts of <i>Vive le Roi</i> and volleys of musketry responded to his
   words. Then a cross was planted beside the column, and a leaden plate
   buried near it, bearing the arms of France, with a Latin inscription, <i>Ludovicus
   Magnus regnat</i>. The weather-beaten voyagers joined their voices in
   the grand hymn of the <i>Vexilla Regis</i>:&mdash;<br /><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The banners of Heaven's King advance,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The mystery of the Cross shines forth;"</span><br /><br />
and renewed shouts of <i>Vive le Roi</i> closed the ceremony.</p>
<p>On that day, the realm of France received on parchment a stupendous accession.
   The fertile plains of Texas; the vast basin of the Mississippi, from its
   frozen northern springs to the sultry borders of the Gulf; from the woody
   ridges of the Alleghanies to the bare peaks of the Rocky Mountains,&mdash;a
   region of savannas and forests, sun-cracked deserts, and grassy prairies,
   watered by a thousand rivers, ranged by a thousand warlike tribes, passed
   beneath the sceptre of the Sultan of Versailles; and all by virtue of
   a feeble human voice, inaudible at half a mile.</p>

   <p>The narrative ascribed to Membr&eacute; and published by Le Clerc is
      based on the document preserved in the Archives Scientifiques de la
      Marine, entitled <i>Relation de la D&eacute;couverte de l'Embouchure

      freely, copying the greater part verbatim, with occasional additions
      of a kind which seem to indicate that he had taken part in the expedition.
      The <i>Relation de la D&eacute;couverte</i>, though written in the

      or perhaps for him by Membr&eacute;.</p>

      west bank of the Mississippi, near the mouth of the Arkansas. They
      were divided into four tribes, living for the most part in separate
      villages. Those first visited by La Salle were the Kappas, or Quapaws,
      a remnant of whom still subsists. The others were the Topingas, or
      Tongengas; the Torimans; and the Osotouoy, or Sauthouis. According
      to Charlevoix, who saw them in 1721, they were regarded as the tallest
      and best-formed Indians in America, and were known as <i>les Beaux
      Hommes</i>. Gravier says that they once lived on the Ohio.</p>

      without reckoning the windings of the river. It may interest sportsmen

      Membr&eacute; is much astonished that such monsters should be born

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_241" id="footnote_241"></a><a href="#fnanchor_241"> <span class="label">[241]</span></a> The Natchez and the Taensas, whose habits and customs were similar,
      did not, in their social organization, differ radically from other
      Indians. The same principle of clanship, or <i>totemship</i>, so widely
      spread, existed in full force among them, combined with their religious
      ideas, and developed into forms of which no other example, equally
      distinct, is to be found. (For Indian clanship, see "The Jesuits in
      North America," <i>Introduction</i>.) Among the Natchez and Taensas,
      the principal clan formed a ruling caste; and its chiefs had the attributes
      of demi-gods. As descent was through the female, the chief's son never
      succeeded him, but the son of one of his sisters; and as she, by the
      usual totemic law, was forced to marry in another clan,&mdash;that
      is, to marry a common mortal,&mdash;her husband, though the destined
      father of a demi-god, was treated by her as little better than a slave.
      She might kill him, if he proved unfaithful; but he was forced to submit
      to her infidelities in silence.</p>
   <p>The customs of the Natchez have been described by Du Pratz, Le Petit,
      Penecaut, and others. Charlevoix visited their temple in 1721, and
      found it in a somewhat shabby condition. At this time, the Taensas
      were extinct. In 1729 the Natchez, enraged by the arbitrary conduct
      of a French commandant, massacred the neighboring settlers, and were
      in consequence expelled from their country and nearly destroyed. A
      few still survive, incorporated with the Creeks; but they have lost
      their peculiar customs.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_244" id="footnote_244"></a><a href="#fnanchor_244"> <span class="label">[244]</span></a> In the passages omitted above, for the sake of brevity, the Ohio
      is mentioned as being called also the <i>Olighin</i>- (Alleghany) <i>Sipou</i>,
      and <i>Chukagoua</i>; and La Salle declares that he takes possession
      of the country with the consent of the nations dwelling in it, of whom
      he names the Chaouanons (Shawanoes), Kious, or Nadouessious (Sioux),
      Chikachas (Chickasaws), Motantees (?), Illinois, Mitchigamias, Arkansas,
      Natchez, and Koroas. This alleged consent is, of course, mere farce.
      If there could be any doubt as to the meaning of the words of La Salle,
      as recorded in the <i>Proc&egrave;s Verbal de la Prise de Possession
      de la Louisiane</i>, it would be set at rest by Le Clerc, who says: "Le
      Sieur de la Salle prit au nom de sa Majest&eacute; possession de ce
      fleuve, <i>de toutes les rivi&egrave;res qui y entrent, et de tous
      les pays qu'elles arrosent</i>." These words are borrowed from the
      report of La Salle (see Thomassy, 14). A copy of the original <i>Proc&egrave;s
      Verbal</i> is before me. It bears the name of Jacques de la Metairie,
      Notary of Fort Frontenac, who was one of the party.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louisiana</span> was the name bestowed by La Salle on the new domain of the French
   crown. The rule of the Bourbons in the West is a memory of the past, but
   the name of the Great King still survives in a narrow corner of their
   lost empire. The Louisiana of to-day is but a single State of the American
   republic. The Louisiana of La Salle stretched from the Alleghanies to
   the Rocky Mountains; from the Rio Grande and the Gulf to the farthest
   springs of the Missouri.<a name="fnanchor_245" id="fnanchor_245"></a><a href="#footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>La Salle had written his name in history; but his hard-earned success
   was but the prelude of a harder task. Herculean labors lay before him,
   if he would realize the schemes with which his brain was pregnant. Bent
   on accomplishing them, he retraced his course, and urged his canoes upward
   against the muddy current. The party were famished. They had little to
   subsist on but the flesh of alligators. When they reached the Quinipissas,
   who had proved hostile on their way down, they resolved to risk an interview
   with them, in the hope of obtaining food. The treacherous savages dissembled,
   brought them corn, and on the following night made an attack upon them,
   but met with a bloody repulse. The party next revisited the Coroas, and
   found an unfavorable change in their disposition towards them. They feasted
   them, indeed, but during the repast surrounded them with an overwhelming
   force of warriors. The French, however, kept so well on their guard, that
   their entertainers dared not make an attack, and suffered them to depart
   unmolested.<a name="fnanchor_246" id="fnanchor_246"></a><a href="#footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">ILLNESS OF LA SALLE.</div>
<p>And now, in a career of unwonted success and anticipated triumph, La Salle
   was arrested by a foe against which the boldest heart avails nothing.
   As he ascended the Mississippi, he was seized by a dangerous illness.
   Unable to proceed, he sent forward <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg
   311]</a></span> Tonty to Michilimackinac, whence, after despatching news
   of their discovery to Canada, he was to return to the Illinois. La Salle
   himself lay helpless at Fort Prudhomme, the palisade work which his men
   had built at the Chickasaw Bluffs on their way down. Father Zenobe Membr&eacute; attended
   him; and at the end of July he was once more in a condition to advance
   by slow movements towards Fort Miami, which he reached in about a month.</p>
<p>In September he rejoined Tonty at Michilimackinac, and in the following
   month wrote to a friend in France: "Though my discovery is made, and I
   have descended the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico, I cannot send you
   this year either an account of my journey or a map. On the way back I
   was attacked by a deadly disease, which kept me in danger of my life for
   forty days, and left me so weak that I could think of nothing for four
   months after. I have hardly strength enough now to write my letters, and
   the season is so far advanced that I cannot detain a single day this canoe
   which I send expressly to carry them. If I had not feared being forced
   to winter on the way, I should have tried to get to Quebec to meet the
   new governor, if it is true that we are to have one; but in my present
   condition this would be an act of suicide, on account of the bad nourishment
   I should have all winter in case the snow and ice stopped me on the way.
   Besides, my presence is absolutely necessary in the place to which I am <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg
   312]</a></span> going. I pray you, my dear sir, to give me once more all
   the help you can. I have great enemies, who have succeeded in all they
   have undertaken. I do not pretend to resist them, but only to justify
   myself, so that I can pursue by sea the plans I have begun here by land."</p>
<p>This was what he had proposed to himself from the first; that is, to abandon
   the difficult access through Canada, beset with enemies, and open a way
   to his western domain through the Gulf and the Mississippi. This was the
   aim of all his toilsome explorations. Could he have accomplished his first
   intention of building a vessel on the Illinois and descending in her to
   the Gulf, he would have been able to defray in good measure the costs
   of the enterprise by means of the furs and buffalo-hides collected on
   the way and carried in her to France. With a fleet of canoes, this was
   impossible; and there was nothing to offset the enormous outlay which
   he and his associates had made. He meant, as we have seen, to found on
   the banks of the Illinois a colony of French and Indians to answer the
   double purpose of a bulwark against the Iroquois and a place of storage
   for the furs of all the western tribes; and he hoped in the following
   year to secure an outlet for this colony and for all the trade of the
   valley of the Mississippi, by occupying the mouth of that river with a
   fort and another colony. This, too, was an essential part of his original
   design.</p>
<p>But for his illness, he would have gone to France <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg
         313]</a></span> to provide for its execution. Meanwhile, he ordered
         Tonty to collect as many men as possible, and begin the projected
         colony on the banks of the Illinois. A report soon after reached
         him that those pests of the wilderness the Iroquois were about to
         renew their attacks on the western tribes. This would be fatal to
         his plans; and, following Tonty to the Illinois, he rejoined him
         near the site of the great town.</p>
<div class="sidenote">"STARVED ROCK."</div>
<p>The cliff called "Starved Rock," now pointed out to travellers as the
   chief natural curiosity of the region, rises, steep on three sides as
   a castle wall, to the height of a hundred and twenty-five feet above the
   river. In front, it overhangs the water that washes its base; its western
   brow looks down on the tops of the forest trees below; and on the east
   lies a wide gorge or ravine, choked with the mingled foliage of oaks,
   walnuts, and elms; while in its rocky depths a little brook creeps down
   to mingle with the river. From the trunk of the stunted cedar that leans
   forward from the brink, you may drop a plummet into the river below, where
   the cat-fish and the turtles may plainly be seen gliding over the wrinkled
   sands of the clear and shallow current. The cliff is accessible only from
   behind, where a man may climb up, not without difficulty, by a steep and
   narrow passage. The top is about an acre in extent. Here, in the month
   of December, La Salle and Tonty began to intrench themselves. They cut
   away the forest that crowned the rock, built store-houses and dwellings
   of its
   remains,  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg
   314]</a></span>dragged timber up the rugged pathway, and encircled the summit

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE'S COLONY.</div>
<p>Thus the winter passed, and meanwhile the work <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg
         315]</a></span> of negotiation went prosperously on. The minds of
         the Indians had been already prepared. In La Salle they saw their
         champion against the Iroquois, the standing terror of all this region.
         They gathered round his stronghold like the timorous peasantry of
         the middle ages around the rock-built castle of their feudal lord.
         From the wooden ramparts of St. Louis,&mdash;for so he named his
         fort,&mdash;high and inaccessible as an eagle's nest, a strange
         scene lay before his eye. The broad, flat valley of the Illinois
         was spread beneath him like a map, bounded in the distance by its
         low wall of woody hills. The river wound at his feet in devious
         channels among islands bordered with lofty trees; then, far on the
         left, flowed calmly westward through the vast meadows, till its
         glimmering blue ribbon was lost in hazy distance.</p>
<p>There had been a time, and that not remote, when these fair meadows were
   a waste of death and desolation, scathed with fire, and strewn with the
   ghastly relics of an Iroquois victory. Now all was changed. La Salle looked
   down from his rock on a concourse of wild human life. Lodges of bark and
   rushes, or cabins of logs, were clustered on the open plain or along the
   edges of the bordering forests. Squaws labored, warriors lounged in the
   sun, naked children whooped and gambolled on the grass. Beyond the river,
   a mile and a half on the left, the banks were studded once more with the
   lodges of the Illinois, who, to the number of six thousand, had returned,
   since their defeat, to this their favorite dwelling-place. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg
   316]</a></span> Scattered along the valley, among the adjacent hills,
   or over the neighboring prairie, were the cantonments of a half-score
   of other tribes and fragments of tribes, gathered under the protecting &aelig;gis
   of the French,&mdash;Shawanoes from the Ohio, Abenakis from Maine, Miamis
   from the sources of the Kankakee, with others whose barbarous names are
   hardly worth the record.<a name="fnanchor_248" id="fnanchor_248"></a><a href="#footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Nor were these La Salle's only dependants. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg
   317]</a></span> By the terms of his patent, he held seigniorial rights
   over this wild domain; and he now began to grant it out in parcels to
   his followers. These, however, were as yet but a score,&mdash;a lawless
   band, trained in forest license, and marrying, as their detractors affirm,
   a new squaw every day in the week. This was after their lord's departure,
   for his presence imposed a check on these eccentricities.</p>
<p>La Salle, in a memoir addressed to the Minister of the Marine, reports
   the total number of the Indians around Fort St. Louis at about four thousand
   warriors, or twenty thousand souls. His diplomacy had <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg
   318]</a></span> been crowned with a marvellous success,&mdash;for which
   his thanks were due, first to the Iroquois, and the universal terror they
   inspired; next, to his own address and unwearied energy. His colony had
   sprung up, as it were, in a night; but might not a night suffice to disperse
   it?</p>
<p>The conditions of maintaining it were twofold: first, he must give efficient
   aid to his savage colonists against the Iroquois; secondly, he must supply
   them with French goods in exchange for their furs. The men, arms, and
   ammunition for their defence, and the goods for trading with them, must
   be brought from Canada, until a better and surer avenue of supply could
   be provided through the entrep&ocirc;t which he meant to establish at
   the mouth of the Mississippi. Canada was full of his enemies; but as long
   as Count Frontenac was in power, he was sure of support. Count Frontenac
   was in power no longer. He had been recalled to France through the intrigues
   of the party adverse to La Salle; and Le Febvre de la Barre reigned in
   his stead.</p>
<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE AND LA BARRE.</div>
<p>La Barre was an old naval officer of rank, advanced to a post for which
   he proved himself notably unfit. If he was without the arbitrary passions
   which had been the chief occasion of the recall of his predecessor, he
   was no less without his energies and his talents. He showed a weakness
   and an avarice for which his age may have been in some measure answerable.
   He was no whit less unscrupulous than his predecessor in his secret violation
   of the royal ordinances <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg
   319]</a></span> regulating the fur-trade, which it was his duty to enforce.
   Like Frontenac, he took advantage of his position to carry on an illicit
   traffic with the Indians; but it was with different associates. The late
   governor's friends were the new governor's enemies; and La Salle, armed
   with his monopolies, was the object of his especial jealousy.<a name="fnanchor_249" id="fnanchor_249"></a><a href="#footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, La Salle, buried in the western wilderness, remained for the
   time ignorant of La Barre's disposition towards him, and made an effort
   to secure his good-will and countenance. He wrote to him from his rock
   of St. Louis, early in the spring of 1683, expressing the hope that he
   should have from him the same support as from Count Frontenac; "although," he
   says, "my enemies will try to influence you against me." His attachment
   to Frontenac, he pursues, has been the cause of all the late governor's
   enemies turning against him. He then recounts his voyage down the Mississippi;
   says that, with twenty-two Frenchmen, he caused all the tribes along the
   river to ask for peace; and speaks of his right under the royal patent
   to build forts anywhere along his route, and grant out lands around them,
   as at Fort Frontenac.</p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg
   320]</a></span></p>
<p>"My losses in my enterprises," he continues, "have exceeded forty thousand
   crowns. I am now going four hundred leagues south-southwest of this place,
   to induce the Chickasaws to follow the Shawanoes and other tribes, and
   settle, like them, at St. Louis. It remained only to settle French colonists
   here, and this I have already done. I hope you will not detain them as <i>coureurs
   de bois</i>, when they come down to Montreal to make necessary purchases.
   I am aware that I have no right to trade with the tribes who descend to
   Montreal, and I shall not permit such trade to my men; nor have I ever
   issued licenses to that effect, as my enemies say that I have done."<a name="fnanchor_250" id="fnanchor_250"></a><a href="#footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>
<p>Again, on the fourth of June following, he writes to La Barre, from the
   Chicago portage, complaining that some of his colonists, going to Montreal
   for necessary supplies, have been detained by his enemies, and begging
   that they may be allowed to return, that his enterprise may not be ruined. "The
   Iroquois," he pursues, "are again invading the country. Last year, the
   Miamis were so alarmed by them that they abandoned their town and fled;
   but at my return they came back, and have been induced to settle with
   the Illinois at my fort of St. Louis. The Iroquois have lately murdered
   some families of their nation, and they are all in terror again. I am
   afraid they will take flight, and so prevent the Missouris and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg
   321]</a></span> neighboring tribes from coming to settle at St. Louis,
   as they are about to do.</p>
<p>"Some of the Hurons and French tell the Miamis that I am keeping them
   here for the Iroquois to destroy. I pray that you will let me hear from
   you, that I may give these people some assurances of protection before
   they are destroyed in my sight. Do not suffer my men who have come down
   to the settlements to be longer prevented from returning. There is great
   need here of reinforcements. The Iroquois, as I have said, have lately
   entered the country; and a great terror prevails. I have postponed going
   to Michilimackinac, because, if the Iroquois strike any blow in my absence,
   the Miamis will think that I am in league with them; whereas, if I and
   the French stay among them, they will regard us as protectors. But, Monsieur,
   it is in vain that we risk our lives here, and that I exhaust my means
   in order to fulfil the intentions of his Majesty, if all my measures are
   crossed in the settlements below, and if those who go down to bring munitions,
   without which we cannot defend ourselves, are detained under pretexts
   trumped up for the occasion. If I am prevented from bringing up men and
   supplies, as I am allowed to do by the permit of Count Frontenac, then
   my patent from the King is useless. It would be very hard for us, after
   having done what was required, even before the time prescribed, and after
   suffering severe losses, to have our efforts frustrated by obstacles got
   up designedly.</p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg
   322]</a></span></p>
<p>"I trust that, as it lies with you alone to prevent or to permit the return
   of the men whom I have sent down, you will not so act as to thwart my
   plans. A part of the goods which I have sent by them belong not to me,
   but to the Sieur de Tonty, and are a part of his pay. Others are to buy
   munitions indispensable for our defence. Do not let my creditors seize
   them. It is for their advantage that my fort, full as it is of goods,
   should be held against the enemy. I have only twenty men, with scarcely
   a hundred pounds of powder; and I cannot long hold the country without
   more. The Illinois are very capricious and uncertain.... If I had men
   enough to send out to reconnoitre the enemy, I would have done so before
   this; but I have not enough. I trust you will put it in my power to obtain
   more, that this important colony may be saved."<a name="fnanchor_251" id="fnanchor_251"></a><a href="#footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>
<p>While La Salle was thus writing to La Barre, La Barre was writing to Seignelay,
   the Marine and Colonial Minister, decrying his correspondent's discoveries,
   and pretending to doubt their reality. "The Iroquois," he adds, "have
   sworn his [La Salle's] death. The imprudence of this man is about to involve
   the colony in war."<a name="fnanchor_252" id="fnanchor_252"></a><a href="#footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> And again he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg
   323]</a></span> writes, in the following spring, to say that La Salle
   was with a score of vagabonds at Green Bay, where he set himself up as
   a king, pillaged his countrymen, and put them to ransom, exposed the tribes
   of the West to the incursions of the Iroquois, and all under pretence
   of a patent from his Majesty, the provisions of which he grossly abused;
   but, as his privileges would expire on the twelfth of May ensuing, he
   would then be forced to come to Quebec, where his creditors, to whom he
   owed more than thirty thousand crowns, were anxiously awaiting him.<a name="fnanchor_253" id="fnanchor_253"></a><a href="#footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>
<p>Finally, when La Barre received the two letters from La Salle, of which
   the substance is given above, he sent copies of them to the Minister Seignelay,
   with the following comment: "By the copies of the Sieur de la Salle's
   letters, you will perceive that his head is turned, and that he has been
   bold enough to give you intelligence of a false discovery, and that, instead
   of returning to the colony to learn what the King wishes him to do, he
   does not come near me, but keeps in the backwoods, five hundred leagues
   off, with the idea of attracting the inhabitants to him, and building
   up an imaginary kingdom for himself, by debauching all the bankrupts and
   idlers of this country. If you will look at the two letters I had from
   him, you can judge the character of this personage better than I can.
   Affairs with the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg
   324]</a></span> Iroquois are in such a state that I cannot allow him to
   muster all their enemies together and put himself at their head. All the
   men who brought me news from him have abandoned him, and say not a word
   about returning, <i>but sell the furs they have brought as if they were
   their own</i>; so that he cannot hold his ground much longer."<a name="fnanchor_254" id="fnanchor_254"></a><a href="#footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Such
   calumnies had their effect. The enemies of La Salle had already gained
   the ear of the King; and he had written in August, from Fontainebleau,
   to his new governor of Canada: "I am convinced, like you, that the discovery
   of the Sieur de la Salle is very useless, and that such enterprises ought
   to be prevented in future, as they tend only to debauch the inhabitants
   by the hope of gain, and to diminish the revenue from beaver-skins."<a name="fnanchor_255" id="fnanchor_255"></a><a href="#footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>
<p>In order to understand the posture of affairs at this time, it must be
   remembered that Dutch and English traders of New York were urging on the
   Iroquois to attack the western tribes, with the object of gaining, through
   their conquest, the control of the fur-trade of the interior, and diverting
   it from Montreal to Albany. The scheme was full of danger to Canada, which
   the loss of the trade would have ruined. La Barre and his associates were
   greatly alarmed at it. Its complete success would have been fatal to their
   hopes of profit; but they nevertheless wished it such a measure of success
   as would ruin their rival, La Salle. Hence, no little satisfaction mingled
   with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span> their
   anxiety when they heard that the Iroquois were again threatening to invade
   the Miamis and the Illinois; and thus La Barre, whose duty it was strenuously
   to oppose the intrigue of the English, and use every effort to quiet the
   ferocious bands whom they were hounding against the Indian allies of the
   French, was, in fact, but half-hearted in the work. He cut off La Salle
   from all supplies; detained the men whom he sent for succor; and, at a
   conference with the Iroquois, told them that they were welcome to plunder
   and kill him.<a name="fnanchor_256" id="fnanchor_256"></a><a href="#footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">A NEW ALARM.</div>
<p>The old governor, and the unscrupulous ring with which he was associated,
   now took a step to which he was doubtless emboldened by the tone of the
   King's letter, in condemnation of La Salle's enterprise. He resolved to
   seize Fort Frontenac, the property of La Salle, under the pretext that
   the latter had not fulfilled the conditions of the grant, and had not
   maintained a sufficient garrison.<a name="fnanchor_257" id="fnanchor_257"></a><a href="#footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Two of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg
   326]</a></span> his associates, La Chesnaye and Le Ber, armed with an
   order from him, went up and took possession, despite the remonstrances
   of La Salle's creditors and mortgagees; lived on La Salle's stores, sold
   for their own profit, and (it is said) that of La Barre, the provisions
   sent by the King, and turned in the cattle to pasture on the growing crops.
   La Forest, La Salle's lieutenant, was told that he might retain the command
   of the fort if he would join the associates; but he refused, and sailed
   in the autumn for France.<a name="fnanchor_258" id="fnanchor_258"></a><a href="#footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile La Salle remained at the Illinois in extreme embarrassment,
   cut off from supplies, robbed of his men who had gone to seek them, and
   disabled from fulfilling the pledges he had given to the surrounding Indians.
   Such was his position, when reports came to Fort St. Louis that the Iroquois
   were at hand. The Indian hamlets were wild with terror, beseeching him
   for succor which he had no power to give. Happily, the report proved false.
   No Iroquois appeared; the threatened attack was postponed, and the summer
   passed away in peace. But La Salle's position, with the governor his declared
   enemy, was intolerable and untenable; and there was no resource but in
   the protection of the court. Early in the autumn, he left Tonty in command
   of the rock, bade farewell to his savage retainers, and descended to Quebec,
   intending to sail for France.</p>
<p>On his way, he met the Chevalier de Baugis, an <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg
         327]</a></span> officer of the King's dragoons, commissioned by
         La Barre to take possession of Fort St. Louis, and bearing letters
         from the governor ordering La Salle to come to Quebec,&mdash;a superfluous
         command, as he was then on his way thither. He smothered his wrath,
         and wrote to Tonty to receive De Baugis well. The chevalier and
         his party proceeded to the Illinois, and took possession of the
         fort,&mdash;De Baugis commanding for the governor, while Tonty remained
         as representative of La Salle. The two officers could not live in
         harmony; but, with the return of spring, each found himself in sore
         need of aid from the other. Towards the end of March the Iroquois
         attacked their citadel, and besieged it for six days, but at length
         withdrew discomfited, carrying with them a number of Indian prisoners,
         most of whom escaped from their clutches.<a name="fnanchor_259" id="fnanchor_259"></a><a href="#footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, La Salle had sailed for France.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_247" id="footnote_247"></a><a href="#fnanchor_247"> <span class="label">[247]</span></a>"Starved Rock" perfectly answers, in every respect, to the indications
      of the contemporary maps and documents concerning "Le Rocher," the
      site of La Salle's fort of St. Louis. It is laid down on several contemporary
      maps, besides the great map of La Salle's discoveries, made in 1684.
      They all place it on the south side of the river; whereas Buffalo Rock,
      three miles above, which has been supposed to be the site of the fort,
      is on the north. The latter is crowned by a plateau of great extent,
      is but sixty feet high, is accessible at many points, and would require
      a large force to defend it; whereas La Salle chose "Le Rocher," because
      a few men could hold it against a multitude. Charlevoix, in 1721, describes
      both rocks, and says that the top of Buffalo Rock had been occupied
      by the Miami village, so that it was known as <i>Le Fort des Miamis</i>.
      This is confirmed by Joutel, who found the Miamis here in 1687. Charlevoix
      then speaks of "Le Rocher," calling it by that name; says that it is
      about a league below, on the left or south side, forming a sheer cliff,
      very high, and looking like a fortress on the border of the river.
      He saw remains of palisades at the top, which, he thinks, were made
      by the Illinois (<i>Journal Historique, Let.</i> xxvii.), though his
      countrymen had occupied it only three years before. "The French reside
      on the rock (Le Rocher), which is very lofty and impregnable." (<i>Memoir
      on Western Indians</i>, 1718, <i>in N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, ix. 890.)
      St. Cosme, passing this way in 1699, mentions it as "Le Vieux Fort," and
      says that it is "a rock about a hundred feet high at the edge of the
      river, where M. de la Salle built a fort, since abandoned." (<i>Journal
      de St. Cosme.</i>) Joutel, who was here in 1687, says, "Fort St. Louis
      is on a steep rock, about two hundred feet high, with the river running
      at its base." He adds that its only defences were palisades. The true
      height, as stated above, is about a hundred and twenty-five feet.</p>
   <p>A traditional interest also attaches to this rock. It is said that,
      in the Indian wars that followed the assassination of Pontiac, a few
      years after the cession of Canada, a party of Illinois, assailed by
      the Pottawattamies, here took refuge, defying attack. At length they
      were all destroyed by starvation, and hence the name of "Starved Rock."</p>
   <p>For other proofs concerning this locality, see <i>ante</i>, 239.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_248" id="footnote_248"></a><a href="#fnanchor_248"> <span class="label">[248]</span></a> This singular extemporized colony of La Salle, on the banks of
      the Illinois, is laid down in detail on the great map of La Salle's
      discoveries, by Jean Baptiste Franquelin, finished in 1684. There can
      be no doubt that this part of the work is composed from authentic data.
      La Salle himself, besides others of his party, came down from the Illinois
      in the autumn of 1683, and undoubtedly supplied the young engineer
      with materials. The various Indian villages, or cantonments, are all
      indicated, with the number of warriors belonging to each, the aggregate
      corresponding very nearly with that of La Salle's report to the minister.
      The Illinois, properly so called, are set down at 1,200 warriors; the
      Miamis, at 1,300; the Shawanoes, at 200; the Ouiatnoens (Weas), at
      500; the Peanqhichia (Piankishaw) band, at 150; the Pepikokia, at 160;
      the Kilatica, at 300; and the Ouabona, at 70,&mdash;in all, 3,880 warriors.
      A few others, probably Abenakis, lived in the fort.</p>
   <p>The Fort St. Louis is placed, on the map, at the exact site of Starved
      Rock, and the Illinois village at the place where, as already mentioned
      (see 239), Indian remains in great quantities are yearly ploughed up.
      The Shawanoe camp, or village, is placed on the south side of the river,
      behind the fort. The country is here hilly, broken, and now, as in
      La Salle's time, covered with wood, which, however, soon ends in the
      open prairie. A short time since, the remains of a low, irregular earthwork
      of considerable extent were discovered at the intersection of two ravines,
      about twenty-four hundred feet behind, or south of, Starved Rock. The
      earthwork follows the line of the ravines on two sides. On the east,
      there is an opening, or gateway, leading to the adjacent prairie. The
      work is very irregular in form, and shows no trace of the civilized
      engineer. In the stump of an oak-tree upon it, Dr. Paul counted a hundred
      and sixty rings of annual growth. The village of the Shawanoes (Chaouenons),
      on Franquelin's map, corresponds with the position of this earthwork.
      I am indebted to the kindness of Dr. John Paul and Col. D. F. Hitt,
      the proprietor of Starved Rock, for a plan of these curious remains
      and a survey of the neighboring district. I must also express my obligations
      to Mr. W. E. Bowman, photographer at Ottawa, for views of Starved Rock
      and other features of the neighboring scenery.</p>
   <p>An interesting relic of the early explorers of this region was found
      a few years ago at Ottawa, six miles above Starved Rock, in the shape
      of a small iron gun, buried several feet deep in the drift of the river.
      It consists of a welded tube of iron, about an inch and a half in calibre,
      strengthened by a series of thick iron rings, cooled on, after the
      most ancient as well as the most recent method of making cannon. It
      is about fourteen inches long, the part near the muzzle having been
      burst off. The construction is very rude. Small field-pieces, on a
      similar principle, were used in the fourteenth century. Several of
      them may be seen at the Mus&eacute;e d'Artillerie at Paris. In the
      time of Louis XIV., the art of casting cannon was carried to a high
      degree of perfection. The gun in question may have been made by a French
      blacksmith on the spot. A far less probable supposition is, that it
      is a relic of some unrecorded visit of the Spaniards; but the pattern
      of the piece would have been antiquated, even in the time of De Soto.</p>

      as his Majesty thinks his subjects better employed in cultivating the
      land. The letter adds, however, that La Salle is to be allowed to continue

<p class="center">LA SALLE PAINTED BY HIMSELF.</p>
<div class="smcap" style="padding-left:1.5em; text-indent:-1.5em">Difficulty of knowing
him: his Detractors; his Letters; vexations of his Position; his Unfitness for Trade;
risks of Correspondence; his Reported Marriage; alleged
Ostentation; motives of Action; charges of Harshness;
intrigues against him; unpopular Manners; a Strange Confession;
his Strength and his Weakness; contrasts of his Character.</div>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have seen La Salle in his acts. While he crosses the sea, let us look
   at him in himself. Few men knew him, even of those who saw him most. Reserved
   and self-contained as he was, with little vivacity or gayety or love of
   pleasure, he was a sealed book to those about him. His daring energy and
   endurance were patent to all; but the motive forces that urged him, and
   the influences that wrought beneath the surface of his character, were
   hidden where few eyes could pierce. His enemies were free to make their
   own interpretations, and they did not fail to use the opportunity.</p>
<p>The interests arrayed against him were incessantly at work. His men were
   persuaded to desert and rob him; the Iroquois were told that he was arming <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg
   329]</a></span> the western tribes against them; the western tribes were
   told that he was betraying them to the Iroquois; his proceedings were
   denounced to the court; and continual efforts were made to alienate his
   associates. They, on their part, sore as they were from disappointment
   and loss, were in a mood to listen to the aspersions cast upon him; and
   they pestered him with letters, asking questions, demanding explanations,
   and dunning him for money. It is through his answers that we are best
   able to judge him; and at times, by those touches of nature which make
   the whole world kin, they teach us to know him and to feel for him.</p>
<div class="sidenote">CHARGES AGAINST LA SALLE.</div>
<p>The main charges against him were that he was a crack-brained schemer,
   that he was harsh to his men, that he traded where he had no right to
   trade, and that his discoveries were nothing but a pretence for making
   money. No accusations appear that touch his integrity or his honor.</p>
<p>It was hard to convince those who were always losing by him. A remittance
   of good dividends would have been his best answer, and would have made
   any other answer needless; but, instead of bills of exchange, he had nothing
   to give but excuses and explanations. In the autumn of 1680, he wrote
   to an associate who had demanded the long-deferred profits: "I have had
   many misfortunes in the last two years. In the autumn of '78, I lost a
   vessel by the fault of the pilot; in the next summer, the deserters I
   told you about robbed me of eight or ten <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg
   330]</a></span> thousand livres' worth of goods. In the autumn of '79,
   I lost a vessel worth more than ten thousand crowns; in the next spring,
   five or six rascals stole the value of five or six thousand livres in
   goods and beaver-skins, at the Illinois, when I was absent. Two other
   men of mine, carrying furs worth four or five thousand livres, were killed
   or drowned in the St. Lawrence, and the furs were lost. Another robbed
   me of three thousand livres in beaver-skins stored at Michilimackinac.
   This last spring, I lost about seventeen hundred livres' worth of goods
   by the upsetting of a canoe. Last winter, the fort and buildings at Niagara
   were burned by the fault of the commander; and in the spring the deserters,
   who passed that way, seized a part of the property that remained, and
   escaped to New York. All this does not discourage me in the least, and
   will only defer for a year or two the returns of profit which you ask
   for this year. These losses are no more my fault than the loss of the
   ship 'St. Joseph' was yours. I cannot be everywhere, and cannot help making
   use of the people of the country."</p>
<p>He begs his correspondent to send out an agent of his own. "He need not
   be very <i>savant</i>, but he must be faithful, patient of labor, and
   fond neither of gambling, women, nor good cheer; for he will find none
   of these with me. Trusting in what he will write you, you may close your
   ears to what priests and Jesuits tell you.</p>
<div class="sidenote">VEXATIONS OF HIS POSITION.</div>
<p>"After having put matters in good trim for trade I <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg
         331]</a></span> mean to withdraw, though I think it will be very
         profitable; for I am disgusted to find that I must always be making
         excuses, which is a part I cannot play successfully. I am utterly
         tired of this business; for I see that it is not enough to put property
         and life in constant peril, but that it requires more pains to answer
         envy and detraction than to overcome the difficulties inseparable
         from my undertaking."</p>
<p>And he makes a variety of proposals, by which he hopes to get rid of a
   part of his responsibility to his correspondent. He begs him again to
   send out a confidential agent, saying that for his part he does not want
   to have any account to render, except that which he owes to the court,
   of his discoveries. He adds, strangely enough for a man burdened with
   such liabilities, "I have neither the habit nor the inclination to keep
   books, nor have I anybody with me who knows how." He says to another correspondent, "I
   think, like you, that partnerships in business are dangerous, on account
   of the little practice I have in these matters." It is not surprising
   that he wanted to leave his associates to manage business for themselves: "You
   know that this trade is good; and with a trusty agent to conduct it for
   you, you run no risk. As for me, I will keep the charge of the forts,
   the command of posts and of men, the management of Indians and Frenchmen,
   and the establishment of the colony, which will remain my property, leaving
   your agent and mine to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg
   332]</a></span> look after our interests, and drawing my half without
   having any hand in what belongs to you."</p>
<p>La Salle was a very indifferent trader; and his heart was not in the commercial
   part of his enterprise. He aimed at achievement, and thirsted after greatness.
   His ambition was to found another France in the West; and if he meant
   to govern it also,&mdash;as without doubt he did,&mdash;it is not a matter
   of wonder or of blame. His misfortune was, that, in the pursuit of a great
   design, he was drawn into complications of business with which he was
   ill fitted to grapple. He had not the instinct of the successful merchant.
   He dared too much, and often dared unwisely; attempted more than he could
   grasp, and forgot, in his sanguine anticipations, to reckon with enormous
   and incalculable risks.</p>
<p>Except in the narrative parts, his letters are rambling and unconnected,&mdash;which
   is natural enough, written, as they were, at odd moments, by camp-fires
   and among Indians. The style is crude; and being well aware of this, he
   disliked writing, especially as the risk was extreme that his letters
   would miss their destination. "There is too little good faith in this
   country, and too many people on the watch, for me to trust anybody with
   what I wish to send you. Even sealed letters are not too safe. Not only
   are they liable to be lost or stopped by the way, but even such as escape
   the curiosity of spies lie at Montreal, waiting a long time to be forwarded."</p>
<div class="sidenote">HIS LETTERS INTERCEPTED.</div>
<p>Again, he writes: "I cannot pardon myself for the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg
         333]</a></span> stoppage of my letters, though I made every effort
         to make them reach you. I wrote to you in '79 (in August), and sent
         my letters to M. de la Forest, who gave them in good faith to my
         brother. I don't know what he has done with them. I wrote you another,
         by the vessel that was lost last year. I sent two canoes, by two
         different routes; but the wind and the rain were so furious that
         they wintered on the way, and I found my letters at the fort on
         my return. I now send you one of them, which I wrote last year to
         M. Thouret, in which you will find a full account of what passed,
         from the time when we left the outlet of Lake Erie down to the sixteenth
         of August, 1680. What preceded was told at full length in the letters
         my brother has seen fit to intercept."</p>
<p>This brother was the Sulpitian priest, Jean Cavelier, who had been persuaded
   that La Salle's enterprise would be ruinous, and therefore set himself
   sometimes to stop it altogether, and sometimes to manage it in his own
   way. "His conduct towards me," says La Salle, "has always been so strange,
   through the small love he bears me, that it was clear gain for me when
   he went away; since while he stayed he did nothing but cross all my plans,
   which I was forced to change every moment to suit his caprice."</p>
<p>There was one point on which the interference of his brother and of his
   correspondents was peculiarly annoying. They thought it for their interest
   that he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span> should
   remain a single man; whereas, it seems that his devotion to his purpose
   was not so engrossing as to exclude more tender subjects. He writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I am told that you have been uneasy about my pretended marriage. I had
   not thought about it at that time; and I shall not make any engagement
   of the sort till I have given you reason to be satisfied with me. It is
   a little extraordinary that I must render account of a matter which is
   free to all the world.</p>
<p>"In fine, Monsieur, it is only as an earnest of something more substantial
   that I write to you so much at length. I do not doubt that you will hereafter
   change the ideas about me which some persons wish to give you, and that
   you will be relieved of the anxiety which all that has happened reasonably
   causes you. I have written this letter at more than twenty different times;
   and I am more than a hundred and fifty leagues from where I began it.
   I have still two hundred more to get over, before reaching the Illinois.
   I am taking with me twenty-five men to the relief of the six or seven
   who remain with the Sieur de Tonty."</p>
<p>This was the journey which ended in that scene of horror at the ruined
   town of the Illinois.</p>
<div class="sidenote">CHARGED WITH OSTENTATION.</div>
<p>To the same correspondent, pressing him for dividends, he says: "You repeat
   continually that you will not be satisfied unless I make you large returns
   of profit. Though I have reason to thank you for what you have done for
   this enterprise, it seems to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg
   335]</a></span> me that I have done still more, since I have put everything
   at stake; and it would be hard to reproach me either with foolish outlays
   or with the ostentation which is falsely imputed to me. Let my accusers
   explain what they mean. Since I have been in this country, I have had
   neither servants nor clothes nor fare which did not savor more of meanness
   than of ostentation; and the moment I see that there is anything with
   which either you or the court find fault, I assure you that I will give
   it up,&mdash;for the life I am leading has no other attraction for me
   than that of honor; and the more danger and difficulty there is in undertakings
   of this sort, the more worthy of honor I think they are."</p>
<p>His career attests the sincerity of these words. They are a momentary
   betrayal of the deep enthusiasm of character which may be read in his
   life, but to which he rarely allowed the faintest expression.</p>
<p>"Above all," he continues, "if you want me to keep on, do not compel me
   to reply to all the questions and fancies of priests and Jesuits. They
   have more leisure than I; and I am not subtle enough to anticipate all
   their empty stories. I could easily give you the information you ask;
   but I have a right to expect that you will not believe all you hear, nor
   require me to prove to you that I am not a madman. That is the first point
   to which you should have attended, before having business with me; and
   in our long acquaintance, either you must have found me out, or else I
   must have had long intervals of sanity."</p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg
   336]</a></span></p>
<p>To another correspondent he defends himself against the charge of harshness
   to his men: "The facility I am said to want is out of place with this
   sort of people, who are libertines for the most part; and to indulge them
   means to tolerate blasphemy, drunkenness, lewdness, and a license incompatible
   with any kind of order. It will not be found that I have in any case whatever
   treated any man harshly, except for blasphemies and other such crimes
   openly committed. These I cannot tolerate: first, because such compliance
   would give grounds for another accusation, much more just; secondly, because,
   if I allowed such disorders to become habitual, it would be hard to keep
   the men in subordination and obedience, as regards executing the work
   I am commissioned to do; thirdly, because the debaucheries, too common
   with this rabble, are the source of endless delays and frequent thieving;
   and, finally, because I am a Christian, and do not want to bear the burden
   of their crimes.</p>
<div class="sidenote">INTRIGUES AGAINST HIM.</div>
<p>"What is said about my servants has not even a show of truth; for I use
   no servants here, and all my men are on the same footing. I grant that
   as those who have lived with me are steadier and give me no reason to
   complain of their behavior, I treat them as gently as I should treat the
   others if they resembled them, and as those who were formerly my servants
   are the only ones I can trust, I speak more openly to them than to the
   rest, who are generally spies of my enemies. The twenty-two men who deserted
   and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span> robbed
   me are not to be believed on their word, deserters and thieves as they
   are. They are ready enough to find some pretext for their crime; and it
   needs as unjust a judge as the intendant to prompt such rascals to enter
   complaints against a person to whom he had given a warrant to arrest them.
   But, to show the falsity of these charges, Martin Chartier, who was one
   of those who excited the rest to do as they did, was never with me at
   all; and the rest had made their plot before seeing me." And he proceeds
   to relate, in great detail, a variety of circumstances to prove that his
   men had been instigated first to desert, and then to slander him; adding, "Those
   who remain with me are the first I had, and they have not left me for
   six years."</p>
<p>"I have a hundred other proofs of the bad counsel given to these deserters,
   and will produce them when wanted; but as they themselves are the only
   witnesses of the severity they complain of, while the witnesses of their
   crimes are unimpeachable, why am I refused the justice I demand, and why
   is their secret escape connived at?</p>
<p>"I do not know what you mean by having popular manners. There is nothing
   special in my food, clothing, or lodging, which are all the same for me
   as for my men. How can it be that I do not talk with them? I have no other
   company. M. de Tonty has often found fault with me because I stopped too
   often to talk with them. You do not know the men one must employ here,
   when you <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span> exhort
   me to make merry with them. They are incapable of that; for they are never
   pleased, unless one gives free rein to their drunkenness and other vices.
   If that is what you call having popular manners, neither honor nor inclination
   would let me stoop to gain their favor in a way so disreputable: and,
   besides, the consequences would be dangerous, and they would have the
   same contempt for me that they have for all who treat them in this fashion.</p>
<p>"You write me that even my friends say that I am not a man of popular
   manners. I do not know what friends they are. I know of none in this country.
   To all appearance they are enemies, more subtle and secret than the rest.
   I make no exceptions; for I know that those who seem to give me support
   do not do it out of love for me, but because they are in some sort bound
   in honor, and that in their hearts they think I have dealt ill with them.
   M. Plet will tell you what he has heard about it himself, and the reasons
   they have to give.<a name="fnanchor_260" id="fnanchor_260"></a><a href="#footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> I have seen it for a long time; and these secret
   stabs they give me show it very plainly. After that, it is not surprising
   that I open my mind to nobody, and distrust everybody. I have reasons
   that I cannot write.</p>
<p>"For the rest, Monsieur, pray be well assured that the information you
   are so good as to give me is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg
   339]</a></span> received with a gratitude equal to the genuine friendship
   from which it proceeds; and, however unjust are the charges made against
   me, I should be much more unjust myself if I did not feel that I have
   as much reason to thank you for telling me of them as I have to complain
   of others for inventing them.</p>
<div class="sidenote">HIS MANNERS.</div>
<p>"As for what you say about my look and manner, I myself confess that you
   are not far from right. But <i>naturam expellas</i>; and if I am wanting
   in expansiveness and show of feeling towards those with whom I associate, <i>it
   is only through a timidity which is natural to me, and which has made
   me leave various employments, where without it I could have succeeded</i>.
   But as I judged myself ill-fitted for them on account of this defect,
   I have chosen a life more suited to my solitary disposition; which, nevertheless,
   does not make me harsh to my people, though, joined to a life among savages,
   it makes me, perhaps, less polished and complaisant than the atmosphere
   of Paris requires. I well believe that there is self-love in this; and
   that, knowing how little I am accustomed to a more polite life, the fear
   of making mistakes makes me more reserved than I like to be. So I rarely
   expose myself to conversation with those in whose company I am afraid
   of making blunders, and can hardly help making them. Abb&eacute; Renaudot
   knows with what repugnance I had the honor to appear before Monseigneur
   de Conti; and sometimes it took me a week to make up my mind to go to
   the audience,&mdash;that is, when I had time to think about <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg
   340]</a></span> myself, and was not driven by pressing business. It is
   much the same with letters, which I never write except when pushed to
   it, and for the same reason. It is a defect of which I shall never rid
   myself as long as I live, often as it spites me against myself, and often
   as I quarrel with myself about it."</p>
<div class="sidenote">HIS STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS.</div>
<p>Here is a strange confession for a man like La Salle. Without doubt, the
   timidity of which he accuses himself had some of its roots in pride; but
   not the less was his pride vexed and humbled by it. It is surprising that,
   being what he was, he could have brought himself to such an avowal under
   any circumstances or any pressure of distress. Shyness; a morbid fear
   of committing himself; and incapacity to express, and much more to simulate,
   feeling,&mdash;a trait sometimes seen in those with whom feeling is most
   deep,&mdash;are strange ingredients in the character of a man who had
   grappled so dauntlessly with life on its harshest and rudest side. They
   were deplorable defects for one in his position. He lacked that sympathetic
   power, the inestimable gift of the true leader of men, in which lies the
   difference between a willing and a constrained obedience. This solitary
   being, hiding his shyness under a cold reserve, could rouse no enthusiasm
   in his followers. He lived in the purpose which he had made a part of
   himself, nursed his plans in secret, and seldom asked or accepted advice.
   He trusted himself, and learned more and more to trust no others. One
   may fairly infer that distrust was natural to him; but the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg
   341]</a></span> inference may possibly be wrong. Bitter experience had
   schooled him to it; for he lived among snares, pitfalls, and intriguing
   enemies. He began to doubt even the associates who, under representations
   he had made them in perfect good faith, had staked their money on his
   enterprise, and lost it, or were likely to lose it. They pursued him with
   advice and complaint, and half believed that he was what his maligners
   called him,&mdash;a visionary or a madman. It galled him that they had
   suffered for their trust in him, and that they had repented their trust.
   His lonely and shadowed nature needed the mellowing sunshine of success,
   and his whole life was a fight with adversity.</p>
<p>All that appears to the eye is his intrepid conflict with obstacles without;
   but this, perhaps, was no more arduous than the invisible and silent strife
   of a nature at war with itself,&mdash;the pride, aspiration, and bold
   energy that lay at the base of his character battling against the superficial
   weakness that mortified and angered him. In such a man, the effect of
   such an infirmity is to concentrate and intensify the force within. In
   one form or another, discordant natures are common enough; but very rarely
   is the antagonism so irreconcilable as it was in him. And the greater
   the antagonism, the greater the pain. There are those in whom the sort
   of timidity from which he suffered is matched with no quality that strongly
   revolts against it. These gentle natures may at least have peace, but
   for him there was no peace.</p>

<p>Cavelier de La Salle stands in history like a statue cast in iron; but
   his own unwilling pen betrays the man, and reveals in the stern, sad figure
   an object of human interest and pity.<a name="fnanchor_261" id="fnanchor_261"></a><a href="#footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

      with La Salle's approval, he carried on the trade of Fort Frontenac,
      in order to indemnify himself for money advanced. La Salle always speaks
      of him with esteem and gratitude.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_261" id="footnote_261"></a><a href="#fnanchor_261"> <span class="label">[261]</span></a> The following is the character of La Salle, as drawn by his friend,
      Abb&eacute; Bernou, in a memorial to the minister Seignelay: "Il est
      irr&eacute;prochable dans ses m&oelig;urs, r&eacute;gl&eacute; dans sa
      conduite, et qui veut de l'ordre parmy ses gens. Il est savant, judicieux,
      politique, vigilant, infatigable, sobre, et intr&eacute;pide. Il entend
      suffisament l'architecture civile, militaire, et navale ainsy que l'agriculture;
      il parle ou entend quatre ou cinq langues des Sauvages, et a beaucoup
      de facilit&eacute; pour apprendre les autres. Il s&ccedil;ait toutes
      leurs mani&egrave;res et obtient d'eux tout ce qu'il veut par son adresse,
      par son &eacute;loquence, et parce qu'il est beaucoup estim&eacute; d'eux.
      Dans ses voyages il ne fait pas meilleure ch&egrave;re que le moindre
      de ses gens et se donne plus de peine que pas un pour les encourager,
      et il y a lieu de croire qu'avec la protection de Monseigneur il fondera
      des colonies plus consid&eacute;rables que toutes celles que les Fran&ccedil;ois
      ont &eacute;tablies jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent."&mdash;<i>M&eacute;moire

   <p>The extracts given in the foregoing chapter are from La Salle's long
      letters of 29 Sept., 1680, and 22 Aug., 1682 (1681?). Both are printed
      in the second volume of the Margry collection, and the originals of
      both are in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale. The latter seems to
      have been written to La Salle's friend, Abb&eacute; Bernou; and the
      former, to a certain M. Thouret.</p>

   ordeal awaited him. He must confront, not painted savages with tomahawk
   and knife, but&mdash;what he shrank from more&mdash;the courtly throngs
   that still live and move in the pages of S&eacute;vign&eacute; and Saint-Simon.</p>
<p>The news of his discovery and the rumor of his schemes were the talk of
   a moment among the courtiers, and then were forgotten. It was not so with
   their master. La Salle's friends and patrons did not fail him. A student
   and a recluse in his youth, and a backwoodsman in his manhood, he had
   what was to him the formidable honor of an interview with royalty itself,
   and stood with such philosophy <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg
   344]</a></span> as he could command before the gilded arm-chair, where,
   majestic and awful, the power of France sat embodied. The King listened
   to all he said; but the results of the interview were kept so secret that
   it was rumored in the ante-chambers that his proposals had been rejected.<a name="fnanchor_262" id="fnanchor_262"></a><a href="#footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>
<p>On the contrary, they had met with more than favor. The moment was opportune
   for La Salle. The King had long been irritated against the Spaniards,
   because they not only excluded his subjects from their American ports,
   but forbade them to enter the Gulf of Mexico. Certain Frenchmen who had
   sailed on this forbidden sea had been seized and imprisoned; and more
   recently a small vessel of the royal navy had been captured for the same
   offence. This had drawn from the King a declaration that every sea should
   be free to all his subjects; and Count d'Estr&eacute;es was sent with
   a squadron to the Gulf, to exact satisfaction of the Spaniards, or fight
   them if they refused it.<a name="fnanchor_263" id="fnanchor_263"></a><a href="#footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> This was in time of peace. War had since
   arisen between the two crowns, and brought with it the opportunity of
   settling the question forever. In order to do so, the minister Seignelay,
   like his father Colbert, proposed to establish a French port on the Gulf,
   as a permanent menace to the Spaniards and a basis of future <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg
   345]</a></span> conquest. It was in view of this plan that La Salle's
   past enterprises had been favored; and the proposals he now made were
   in perfect accord with it.</p>
<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE'S PROPOSALS.</div>
<p>These proposals were set forth in two memorials. The first of them states
   that the late Monseigneur Colbert deemed it important for the service
   of his Majesty to discover a port in the Gulf of Mexico; that to this
   end the memorialist, La Salle, made five journeys of upwards of five thousand
   leagues, in great part on foot; and traversed more than six hundred leagues
   of unknown country, among savages and cannibals, at the cost of a hundred
   and fifty thousand francs. He now proposes to return by way of the Gulf
   of Mexico and the mouth of the Mississippi to the countries he has discovered,
   whence great benefits may be expected: first, the cause of God may be
   advanced by the preaching of the gospel to many Indian tribes; and, secondly,
   great conquests may be effected for the glory of the King, by the seizure
   of provinces rich in silver mines, and defended only by a few indolent
   and effeminate Spaniards. The Sieur de la Salle, pursues the memorial,
   binds himself to be ready for the accomplishment of this enterprise within
   one year after his arrival on the spot; and he asks for this purpose only
   one vessel and two hundred men, with their arms, munitions, pay, and maintenance.
   When Monseigneur shall direct him, he will give the details of what he
   proposes. The memorial then describes the boundless extent, the fertility
   and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span> resources
   of the country watered by the river Colbert, or Mississippi; the necessity
   of guarding it against foreigners, who will be eager to seize it now that
   La Salle's discovery has made it known; and the ease with which it may
   be defended by one or two forts at a proper distance above its mouth,
   which would form the key to an interior region eight hundred leagues in
   extent. "Should foreigners anticipate us," he adds, "they will complete
   the ruin of New France, which they already hem in by their establishments
   of Virginia, Pennsylvania, New England, and Hudson's Bay."<a name="fnanchor_264" id="fnanchor_264"></a><a href="#footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>
<p>The second memorial is more explicit. The place, it says, which the Sieur
   de la Salle proposes to fortify, is on the river Colbert, or Mississippi,
   sixty leagues above its mouth, where the soil is very fertile, the climate
   very mild, and whence we, the French, may control the continent,&mdash;since,
   the river being narrow, we could defend ourselves by means of fire-ships
   against a hostile fleet, while the position is excellent both for attacking
   an enemy or retreating in case of need. The neighboring Indians detest
   the Spaniards, but love the French, having been won over by the kindness
   of the Sieur de la Salle. We could form of them an army of more than fifteen
   thousand savages, who, supported by the French and Abenakis, followers
   of the Sieur de la Salle, could easily subdue the province of New Biscay
   (the most northern province of Mexico), where there are but <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg
   347]</a></span> four hundred Spaniards, more fit to work the mines than
   to fight. On the north of New Biscay lie vast forests, extending to the
   river Seignelay<a name="fnanchor_265" id="fnanchor_265"></a><a href="#footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> (Red River), which is but forty or fifty leagues
   from the Spanish province. This river affords the means of attacking it
   to great advantage.</p>
<p>In view of these facts, pursues the memorial, the Sieur de la Salle offers,
   if the war with Spain continues, to undertake this conquest with two hundred
   men from France. He will take on his way fifty buccaneers at St. Domingo,
   and direct the four thousand Indian warriors at Fort St. Louis of the
   Illinois to descend the river and join him. He will separate his force
   into three divisions, and attack at the same time the centre and the two
   extremities of the province. To accomplish this great design, he asks
   only for a vessel of thirty guns, a few cannon for the forts, and power
   to raise in France two hundred such men as he shall think fit, to be armed,
   paid, and maintained six months at the King's charge. And the Sieur de
   la Salle binds himself, if the execution of this plan is prevented for
   more than three years, by peace with Spain, to refund to his Majesty all
   the costs of the enterprise, on pain of forfeiting the government of the
   ports he will have established.<a name="fnanchor_266" id="fnanchor_266"></a><a href="#footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg
   348]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">LA SALLES'S PLANS.</div>
<p>Such, in brief, was the substance of this singular proposition. And, first,
   it is to be observed that it is based on a geographical blunder, the nature
   of which is explained by the map of La Salle's discoveries made in this
   very year. Here the river Seignelay, or Red River, is represented as running
   parallel to the northern border of Mexico, and at no great distance from
   it,&mdash;the region now called Texas being almost entirely suppressed.
   According to the map, New Biscay might be reached from this river in a
   few days; and, after crossing the intervening forests, the coveted mines
   of Ste. Barbe, or Santa Barbara, would be within striking distance.<a name="fnanchor_267" id="fnanchor_267"></a><a href="#footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
   That La Salle believed in the possibility of invading the Spanish province
   of New Biscay from Red River there can be no doubt; neither can it reasonably
   be doubted that he hoped at some future day to make the attempt; and yet
   it is incredible that a man in his sober senses could have proposed this
   scheme with the intention of attempting to execute it at the time and
   in the manner which he indicates.<a name="fnanchor_268" id="fnanchor_268"></a><a href="#footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> This memorial bears <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg
   349]</a></span> some indications of being drawn up in order to produce
   a certain effect on the minds of the King and his minister. La Salle's
   immediate necessity was to obtain from them the means for establishing
   a fort and a colony within the mouth of the Mississippi. This was essential
   to his own plans; nor did he in the least exaggerate the value of such
   an establishment to the French nation, and the importance of anticipating
   other powers in the possession of it. But he thought that he needed a
   more glittering lure to attract the eyes of Louis and Seignelay; and thus,
   it may be, he held before them, in a definite and tangible form, the project
   of Spanish conquest which had haunted his imagination from youth,&mdash;trusting
   that the speedy conclusion of peace, which actually took place, would
   absolve him from the immediate execution of the scheme, and give him time,
   with the means placed at his disposal, to mature his plans and prepare
   for eventual action. Such a procedure may be charged with indirectness;
   but there is a different explanation, which we shall suggest hereafter,
   and which implies no such reproach.<a name="fnanchor_269" id="fnanchor_269"></a><a href="#footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg
   350]</a></span></p>
<p>Even with this madcap enterprise lopped off, La Salle's scheme of Mississippi
   trade and colonization, perfectly sound in itself, was too vast for an
   individual,&mdash;above all, for one crippled and crushed with debt. While
   he grasped one link of the great chain, another, no less essential, escaped
   from his hand; while he built up a colony on the Mississippi, it was reasonably
   certain that evil would befall his distant colony of the Illinois.</p>
<div class="sidenote">LA BARRE REBUKED.</div>
<p>The glittering project which he now unfolded found favor in the eyes of
   the King and his minister; for both were in the flush of an unparalleled
   success, and looked in the future, as in the past, for nothing but triumphs.
   They granted more than the petitioner asked, as indeed they well might,
   if they expected the accomplishment of all that he proposed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg
   351]</a></span> to attempt. La Forest, La Salle's lieutenant, ejected
   from Fort Frontenac by La Barre, was now at Paris; and he was despatched
   to Canada, empowered to reoccupy, in La Salle's name, both Fort Frontenac
   and Fort St. Louis of the Illinois. The King himself wrote to La Barre
   in a strain that must have sent a cold thrill through the veins of that
   official. "I hear," he says, "that you have taken possession of Fort Frontenac,
   the property of the Sieur de la Salle, driven away his men, suffered his
   land to run to waste, and even told the Iroquois that they might seize
   him as an enemy of the colony." He adds, that, if this is true, La Barre
   must make reparation for the wrong, and place all La Salle's property,
   as well as his men, in the hands of the Sieur de la Forest, "as I am satisfied
   that Fort Frontenac was not abandoned, as you wrote to me that it had
   been."<a name="fnanchor_270" id="fnanchor_270"></a><a href="#footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Four days later, he wrote to the intendant of Canada, De Meules,
   to the effect that the bearer, La Forest, is to suffer no impediment,
   and that La Barre is to surrender to him without reserve all that belongs
   to La Salle.<a name="fnanchor_271" id="fnanchor_271"></a><a href="#footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Armed with this letter, La Forest sailed for Canada.<a name="fnanchor_272" id="fnanchor_272"></a><a href="#footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg
   352]</a></span></p>
<p>A chief object of his mission, as it was represented to Seignelay, was,
   not only to save the colony at the Illinois from being broken up by La
   Barre, but also to collect La Salle's scattered followers, muster the
   savage warriors around the rock of St. Louis, and lead the whole down
   the Mississippi, to co-operate in the attack on New Biscay. If La Salle
   meant that La Forest should seriously attempt to execute such a scheme,
   then the charges of his enemies that his brain was turned were better
   founded than he would have us think.<a name="fnanchor_273" id="fnanchor_273"></a><a href="#footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">PREPARATION.</div>
<p>He had asked for two vessels,<a name="fnanchor_274" id="fnanchor_274"></a><a href="#footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> and four were given to him. Agents
   were sent to Rochelle and Rochefort to gather recruits. A hundred soldiers
   were enrolled, besides mechanics and laborers; and thirty volunteers, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg
   353]</a></span> including gentlemen and burghers of condition, joined
   the expedition. And, as the plan was one no less of colonization than
   of war, several families embarked for the new land of promise, as well
   as a number of girls, lured by the prospect of almost certain matrimony.
   Nor were missionaries wanting. Among them was La Salle's brother, Cavelier,
   and two other priests of St. Sulpice. Three R&eacute;collets were added,&mdash;Zenobe
   Membr&eacute;, who was then in France, Anastase Douay, and Maxime Le Clerc.
   The principal vessel was the "Joly," belonging to the royal navy, and
   carrying thirty-six guns. Another armed vessel of six guns was added,
   together with a store-ship and a ketch.</p>
<p>La Salle had asked for sole command of the expedition, with a subaltern
   officer, and one or two pilots to sail the vessels as he should direct.
   Instead of complying, Seignelay gave the command of the vessels to Beaujeu,
   a captain of the royal navy,&mdash;whose authority was restricted to their
   management at sea, while La Salle was to prescribe the route they were
   to take, and have entire control of the troops and colonists on land.<a name="fnanchor_275" id="fnanchor_275"></a><a href="#footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
   This arrangement displeased both parties. Beaujeu, an old and experienced
   officer, was galled that a civilian should be set over him,&mdash;and
   he, too, a burgher lately ennobled; nor was La Salle the man to soothe
   his ruffled spirit. Detesting a divided command, cold, reserved, and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg
   354]</a></span> impenetrable, he would have tried the patience of a less
   excitable colleague. Beaujeu, on his part, though set to a task which
   he disliked, seems to have meant to do his duty, and to have been willing
   at the outset to make the relations between himself and his unwelcome
   associate as agreeable as possible. Unluckily, La Salle discovered that
   the wife of Beaujeu was devoted to the Jesuits. We have seen the extreme
   distrust with which he regarded these guides of his youth, and he seems
   now to have fancied that Beaujeu was their secret ally. Possibly, he suspected
   that information of his movements would be given to the Spaniards; more
   probably, he had undefined fears of adverse machinations. Granting that
   such existed, it was not his interest to stimulate them by needlessly
   exasperating the naval commander. His deportment, however, was not conciliating;
   and Beaujeu, prepared to dislike him, presently lost temper. While the
   vessels still lay at Rochelle; while all was bustle and preparation; while
   stores, arms, and munitions were embarking; while boys and vagabonds were
   enlisting as soldiers for the expedition,&mdash;Beaujeu was venting his
   disgust in long letters to the minister.</p>
<div class="sidenote">BEAUJEU AND LA SALLE.</div>
<p>"You have ordered me, Monseigneur, to give all possible aid to this undertaking,
   and I shall do so to the best of my power; but permit me to take great
   credit to myself, for I find it very hard to submit to the orders of the
   Sieur de la Salle, whom I believe to be a man of merit, but who has no
   experience of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg
   355]</a></span> war except with savages, and who has no rank, while I
   have been captain of a ship thirteen years, and have served thirty by
   sea and land. Besides, Monseigneur, he has told me that in case of his
   death you have directed that the Sieur de Tonty shall succeed him. This,
   indeed, is very hard; for, though I am not acquainted with that country,
   I should be very dull, if, being on the spot, I did not know at the end
   of a month as much of it as they do. I beg, Monseigneur, that I may at
   least share the command with them; and that, as regards war, nothing may
   be done without my knowledge and concurrence,&mdash;for, as to their commerce,
   I neither intend nor desire to know anything about it."</p>
<p>Seignelay answered by a rebuff, and told him to make no trouble about
   the command. This increased his irritation, and he wrote: "In my last
   letter, Monseigneur, I represented to you the hardship of compelling me
   to obey M. de la Salle, who has no rank, and <i>never commanded anybody
   but school-boys</i>; and I begged you at least to divide the command between
   us. I now, Monseigneur, take the liberty to say that I will obey without
   repugnance, if you order me to do so, having reflected that there can
   be no competition between the said Sieur de la Salle and me.</p>
<p>"Thus far, he has not told me his plan; and he changes his mind every
   moment. He is a man so suspicious, and so afraid that one will penetrate
   his secrets, that I dare not ask him anything. He says <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg
   356]</a></span> that M. de Parassy, commissary's clerk, with whom he has
   often quarrelled, is paid by his enemies to defeat his undertaking; and
   many other things with which I will not trouble you....</p>
<p>"He pretends that I am only to command the sailors, and have no authority
   over the volunteer officers and the hundred soldiers who are to take passage
   in the 'Joly;' and that they are not to recognize or obey me in any way
   during the voyage....</p>
<p>"He has covered the decks with boxes and chests of such prodigious size
   that neither the cannon nor the capstan can be worked."</p>
<p>La Salle drew up a long list of articles, defining the respective rights
   and functions of himself and Beaujeu, to whom he presented it for signature.
   Beaujeu demurred at certain military honors demanded by La Salle, saying
   that if a marshal of France should come on board his ship, he would have
   none left to offer him. The point was referred to the naval intendant;
   and the articles of the treaty having been slightly modified, Beaujeu
   set his name to it. "By this," he says, "you can judge better of the character
   of M. de la Salle than by all I can say. He is a man who wants smoke [form
   and ceremony]. I will give him his fill of it, and, perhaps, more than
   he likes.</p>
<p>"I am bound to an unknown country, to seek what is about as hard to find
   as the philosopher's stone. It vexes me, Monseigneur, that you should <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg
   357]</a></span> have been involved in a business the success of which
   is very uncertain. M. de la Salle begins to doubt it himself."</p>
<p>While Beaujeu wrote thus to the minister, he was also writing to Cabart
   de Villermont, one of his friends at Paris, with whom La Salle was also
   on friendly terms. These letters are lively and entertaining, and by no
   means suggestive of any secret conspiracy. He might, it is true, have
   been more reserved in his communications; but he betrays no confidence,
   for none was placed in him. It is the familiar correspondence of an irritable
   but not ill-natured veteran, who is placed in an annoying position, and
   thinks he is making the best of it.</p>
<p>La Salle thought that the minister had been too free in communicating
   the secrets of the expedition to the naval intendant at Rochefort, and
   through him to Beaujeu. It is hard to see how Beaujeu was to blame for
   this; but La Salle nevertheless fell into a dispute with him. "He could
   hardly keep his temper, and used expressions which obliged me to tell
   him that I cared very little about his affairs, and that the King himself
   would not speak as he did. He retracted, made excuses, and we parted good
   friends....</p>
<p>"I do not like his suspiciousness. I think him a good, honest Norman;
   but Normans are out of fashion. It is one thing to-day, another to-morrow.
   It seems to me that he is not so sure about his undertaking as he was
   at Paris. This morning he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg
   358]</a></span> came to see me, and told me he had changed his mind, and
   meant to give a new turn to the business, and go to another coast. He
   gave very poor reasons, to which I assented, to avoid a quarrel. I thought,
   by what he said, that he wanted to find a scapegoat to bear the blame,
   in case his plan does not succeed as he hopes. For the rest, I think him
   a brave man and a true; and I am persuaded that if this business fails,
   it will be because he does not know enough, and will not trust us of the
   profession. As for me, I shall do my best to help him, as I have told
   you before; and I am delighted to have him keep his secret, so that I
   shall not have to answer for the result. Pray do not show my letters,
   for fear of committing me with him. He is too suspicious already; and
   never was Norman so Norman as he, which is a great hinderance to business."</p>
<p>Beaujeu came from the same province and calls himself jocularly <i>un
      bon gros Normand</i>. His good-nature, however, rapidly gave way as
      time went on. "Yesterday," he writes, "this Monsieur told me that he
      meant to go to the Gulf of Mexico. A little while ago, as I said before,
      he talked about going to Canada. I see nothing certain in it. It is
      not that I do not believe that all he says is true; but not being of
      the profession, and not liking to betray his ignorance, he is puzzled
      what to do.</p>
<p>"I shall go straight forward, without regarding a thousand whims and <i>bagatelles</i>.
   His continual suspicion would drive anybody mad except a Norman <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg
   359]</a></span> like me; but I shall humor him, as I have always done,
   even to sailing my ship on dry land, if he likes."</p>
<div class="sidenote">AN OPEN QUARREL.</div>
<p>A few days later, there was an open quarrel. "M. de la Salle came to me,
   and said, rather haughtily and in a tone of command, that I must put provisions
   for three months more on board my vessel. I told him it was impossible,
   as she had more lading already than anybody ever dared to put in her before.
   He would not hear reason, but got angry and abused me in good French,
   and found fault with me because the vessel would not hold his three months'
   provisions. He said I ought to have told him of it before. 'And how would
   you have me tell you,' said I, 'when you never tell me what you mean to
   do?' We had still another quarrel. He asked me where his officers should
   take their meals. I told him that they might take them where he pleased;
   for I gave myself no trouble in the matter, having no orders. He answered
   that they should not mess on bacon, while the rest ate fowls and mutton.
   I said that if he would send fowls and mutton on board, his people should
   eat them; but, as for bacon, I had often ate it myself. At this, he went
   off and complained to M. Dugu&eacute; that I refused to embark his provisions,
   and told him that he must live on bacon. I excused him as not knowing
   how to behave himself, having spent his life among school-boy brats and
   savages. Nevertheless, I offered to him, his brother, and two of his friends,
   seats at my table and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg
   360]</a></span> the same fare as myself. He answered my civility by an
   impertinence, saying that he distrusted people who offered so much and
   seemed so obliging. I could not help telling him that I saw he was brought
   up in the provinces."</p>
<p>This was touching La Salle on a sensitive point. Beaujeu continues: "In
   fact, you knew him better than I; for I always took him for a gentleman
   (<i>honn&ecirc;te homme</i>). I see now that he is anything but that.
   Pray set Abb&eacute; Renaudot and M. Morel right about this man, and tell
   them he is not what they take him for. Adieu. It has struck twelve: the
   postman is just going."</p>
<p>Bad as was the state of things, it soon grew worse. Renaudot wrote to
   La Salle that Beaujeu was writing to Villermont everything that happened,
   and that Villermont showed the letters to all his acquaintance. Villermont
   was a relative of the Jesuit Beschefer; and this was sufficient to suggest
   some secret machination to the mind of La Salle. Villermont's fault, however,
   seems to have been simple indiscretion, for which Beaujeu took him sharply
   to task. "I asked you to burn my letters; and I cannot help saying that
   I am angry with you, not because you make known my secrets, but because
   you show letters scrawled in haste, and sent off without being even read
   over. M. de la Salle not having told me his secret, though M. de Seignelay
   ordered him to tell me, I am not obliged to keep it, and have as good
   a right as anybody to make my <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg
   361]</a></span> conjectures on what I read about it in the <i>Gazette
   de Hollande</i>. Let Abb&eacute; Renaudot glorify M. de la Salle as much
   as he likes, and make him a Cortez, a Pizarro, or an Almagro,&mdash;that
   is nothing to me; but do not let him speak of me as an obstacle in his
   hero's way. Let him understand that I know how to execute the orders of
   the court as well as he....</p>
<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE'S INDISCRETION.</div>
<p>"You ask how I get on with M. de la Salle. Don't you know that this man
   is impenetrable, and that there is no knowing what he thinks of one? He
   told a person of note whom I will not name that he had suspicions about
   our correspondence, as well as about Madame de Beaujeu's devotion to the
   Jesuits. His distrust is incredible. If he sees one of his people speak
   to the rest, he suspects something, and is gruff with them. He told me
   himself that he wanted to get rid of M. de Tonty, who is in America."</p>
<p>La Salle's claim to exclusive command of the soldiers on board the "Joly" was
   a source of endless trouble. Beaujeu declared that he would not set sail
   till officers, soldiers, and volunteers had all sworn to obey him when
   at sea; at which La Salle had the indiscretion to say, "If I am not master
   of my soldiers, how can I make him [Beaujeu] do his duty in case he does
   not want to do it?"</p>
<p>Beaujeu says that this affair made a great noise among the officers at
   Rochefort, and adds: "<i>There are very few people who do not think that
   his brain is touched.</i> I have spoken to some who have known <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg
   362]</a></span> him twenty years. They all say that he was always rather
   visionary."</p>
<p>It is difficult not to suspect that the current belief at Rochefort had
   some foundation; and that the deadly strain of extreme hardship, prolonged
   anxiety, and alternation of disaster and success, joined to the fever
   which nearly killed him, had unsettled his judgment and given a morbid
   development to his natural defects. His universal suspicion, which included
   even the stanch and faithful Henri de Tonty; his needless provocation
   of persons whose good-will was necessary to him; his doubts whether he
   should sail for the Gulf or for Canada, when to sail to Canada would have
   been to renounce, or expose to almost certain defeat, an enterprise long
   cherished and definitely planned,&mdash;all point to one conclusion. It
   may be thought that his doubts were feigned, in order to hide his destination
   to the last moment; but if so, he attempted to blind not only his ill
   wishers, but his mother, whom he also left in uncertainty as to his route.</p>
<div class="sidenote">AN OVERWROUGHT BRAIN.</div>
<p>Unless we assume that his scheme of invading Mexico was thrown out as
   a bait to the King, it is hard to reconcile it with the supposition of
   mental soundness. To base so critical an attempt on a geographical conjecture,
   which rested on the slightest possible information, and was in fact a
   total error; to postpone the perfectly sound plan of securing the mouth
   of the Mississippi, to a wild project of leading fifteen thousand savages
   for an unknown distance <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg
   363]</a></span> through an unknown country to attack an unknown enemy,&mdash;was
   something more than Quixotic daring. The King and the minister saw nothing
   impracticable in it, for they did not know the country or its inhabitants.
   They saw no insuperable difficulty in mustering and keeping together fifteen
   thousand of the most wayward and unstable savages on earth, split into
   a score and more of tribes, some hostile to each other and some to the
   French; nor in the problem of feeding such a mob, on a march of hundreds
   of miles; nor in the plan of drawing four thousand of them from the Illinois,
   nearly two thousand miles distant, though some of these intended allies
   had no canoes or other means of transportation, and though, travelling
   in such numbers, they would infallibly starve on the way to the rendezvous.
   It is difficult not to see in all this the chimera of an overwrought brain,
   no longer able to distinguish between the possible and the impossible.</p>
<p>Preparation dragged slowly on; the season was growing late; the King grew
   impatient, and found fault with the naval intendant. Meanwhile, the various
   members of the expedition had all gathered at Rochelle. Joutel, a fellow-townsman
   of La Salle, returning to his native Rouen, after sixteen years in the
   army, found all astir with the new project. His father had been gardener
   to Henri Cavelier, La Salle's uncle; and being of an adventurous spirit
   he volunteered for the enterprise, of which he was to become the historian.
   With La Salle's brother the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg
   364]</a></span> priest, and two of his nephews, one of whom was a boy
   of fourteen, Joutel set out for Rochelle, where all were to embark together
   for their promised land.<a name="fnanchor_276" id="fnanchor_276"></a><a href="#footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

      as inhabited by Indians, called Terliquiquimechi, and known to the
      Spaniards as <i>Indios bravos</i>, or <i>Indios de guerra</i>. The
      Spaniards, it is added, were in great fear of them, as they made frequent
      inroads into Mexico. La Salle's Mexican geography was in all respects
      confused and erroneous; nor was Seignelay better informed. Indeed,
      Spanish jealousy placed correct information beyond their reach.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_268" id="footnote_268"></a><a href="#fnanchor_268"> <span class="label">[268]</span></a>  While the plan, as proposed in the memorial, was clearly impracticable,
      the subsequent experience of the French in Texas tended to prove that
      the tribes of that region could be used with advantage in attacking
      the Spaniards of Mexico, and that an inroad on a comparatively small
      scale might have been successfully made with their help. In 1689, Tonty
      actually made the attempt, as we shall see, but failed, from the desertion
      of his men. In 1697, the Sieur de Louvigny wrote to the Minister of
      the Marine, asking to complete La Salle's discoveries, and invade Mexico
      from Texas. (<i>Lettre de M. de Louvigny, 14 Oct., 1697.</i>) In an
      unpublished memoir of the year 1700, the seizure of the Mexican mines
      is given as one of the motives of the colonization of Louisiana.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_269" id="footnote_269"></a><a href="#fnanchor_269"> <span class="label">[269]</span></a>  Another scheme, with similar aims, but much more practicable,
      was at this very time before the court. Count Pe&ntilde;alossa, a Spanish
      Creole, born in Peru, had been governor of New Mexico, where he fell
      into a dispute with the Inquisition, which involved him in the loss
      of property, and for a time of liberty. Failing to obtain redress in
      Spain, he renounced his allegiance in disgust, and sought refuge in
      France, where, in 1682, he first proposed to the King the establishment
      of a colony of French buccaneers at the mouth of Rio Bravo, on the
      Gulf of Mexico. In January, 1684, after the war had broken out, he
      proposed to attack the Spanish town of Panuco, with twelve hundred
      buccaneers from St. Domingo; then march into the interior, seize the
      mines, conquer Durango, and occupy New Mexico. It was proposed to combine
      his plan with that of La Salle; but the latter, who had an interview
      with him, expressed distrust, and showed characteristic reluctance
      to accept a colleague. It is extremely probable, however, that his
      knowledge of Pe&ntilde;alossa's original proposal had some influence
      in stimulating him to lay before the court proposals of his own, equally
      attractive. Peace was concluded before the plans of the Spanish adventurer
      could be carried into effect.</p>

         1684.</i></p>
   <p>There is before me a promissory note of La Salle to La Forest, of 5,200
      livres, dated at Rochelle, 17 July, 1684. This seems to be pay due
      to La Forest, who had served as La Salle's officer for nine years.
      A memorandum is attached, signed by La Salle, to the effect that it
      is his wish that La Forest reimburse himself, "<i>par pr&eacute;f&eacute;rence</i>," out
      of any property of his (La Salle's) in France or Canada.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_273" id="footnote_273"></a><a href="#fnanchor_273"> <span class="label">[273]</span></a> The attitude of La Salle, in this matter, is incomprehensible.
      In July, La Forest was at Rochefort, complaining because La Salle had
      ordered him to stay in garrison at Fort Frontenac. <i>Beaujeu &agrave; Villermont,
      10 July, 1684</i>. This means an abandonment of the scheme of leading
      the warriors at the rock of St. Louis down the Mississippi; but, in
      the next month, La Salle writes to Seignelay that he is afraid La Barre
      will use the Iroquois war as a pretext to prevent La Forest from making
      his journey (to the Illinois), and that in this case he will himself
      try to go up the Mississippi, and meet the Illinois warriors; so that,
      in five or six months from the date of the letter, the minister will
      hear of his departure to attack the Spaniards. (<i>La Salle &agrave; Seignelay,
      Ao&ucirc;t, 1684.</i>) Either this is sheer folly, or else it is meant
      to delude the minister.</p>

      Machaut-Rougemont, written at Rochefort, just after the departure of
      the expedition from Rochelle, and giving some idea of the views there
      entertained concerning it. He says: "L'on ne peut pas faire plus d'extravagances

Domingo.&mdash;La Salle Attacked with Fever: his Desperate Condition.&mdash;The
Gulf Of Mexico.&mdash;A Vain Search and a Fatal Error.</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> four ships sailed from Rochelle on the twenty-fourth of July. Four
   days after, the "Joly" broke her bowsprit, by design as La Salle fancied.
   They all put back to Rochefort, where the mischief was quickly repaired;
   and they put to sea again. La Salle, and the chief persons of the expedition,
   with a crowd of soldiers, artisans, and women, the destined mothers of
   Louisiana, were all on board the "Joly." Beaujeu wished to touch at Madeira,
   to replenish his water-casks. La Salle refused, lest by doing so the secret
   of the enterprise might reach the Spaniards. One Paget, a Huguenot, took
   up the word in support of Beaujeu. La Salle told him that the affair was
   none of his; and as Paget persisted with increased warmth and freedom,
   he demanded of Beaujeu if it was with his consent that a man of no rank
   spoke to him in that manner. Beaujeu sustained <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg
   367]</a></span> the Huguenot. "That is enough," returned La Salle, and
   withdrew into his cabin.<a name="fnanchor_278" id="fnanchor_278"></a><a href="#footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>
<p>This was not the first misunderstanding; nor was it the last. There was
   incessant chafing between the two commanders; and the sailors of the "Joly" were
   soon of one mind with their captain. When the ship crossed the tropic,
   they made ready a tub on deck to baptize the passengers, after the villanous
   practice of the time; but La Salle refused to permit it, at which they
   were highly exasperated, having promised themselves a bountiful ransom,
   in money or liquor, from their victims. "Assuredly," says Joutel, "they
   would gladly have killed us all."</p>
<div class="sidenote">ST. DOMINGO.</div>
<p>When, after a wretched voyage of two months the ships reached St. Domingo,
   a fresh dispute occurred. It had been resolved at a council of officers
   to stop at Port de Paix; but Beaujeu, on pretext of a fair wind, ran by
   that place in the night, and cast anchor at Petit Goave, on the other
   side of the island. La Salle was extremely vexed; for he expected to meet
   at Port de Paix the Marquis de Saint-Laurent, lieutenant-general of the
   islands, B&eacute;gon the intendant, and De Cussy, governor of La Tortue,
   who had orders to supply him with provisions and give him all possible
   aid.</p>
<p>The "Joly" was alone: the other vessels had lagged behind. She had more
   than fifty sick men on <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg
   368]</a></span> board, and La Salle was of the number. He sent a messenger
   to Saint-Laurent, B&eacute;gon, and Cussy, begging them to come to him;
   ordered Joutel to get the sick ashore, suffocating as they were in the
   hot and crowded ship; and caused the soldiers to be landed on a small
   island in the harbor. Scarcely had the voyagers sung <i>Te Deum</i> for
   their safe arrival, when two of the lagging vessels appeared, bringing
   tidings that the third, the ketch "St. Fran&ccedil;ois," had been taken
   by Spanish buccaneers. She was laden with provisions, tools, and other
   necessaries for the colony; and the loss was irreparable. Beaujeu was
   answerable for it; for had he anchored at Port de Paix, it would not have
   occurred. The lieutenant-general, with B&eacute;gon and Cussy, who presently
   arrived, plainly spoke their minds to him.<a name="fnanchor_279" id="fnanchor_279"></a><a href="#footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">ILLNESS OF LA SALLE.</div>
<p>La Salle's illness increased. "I was walking with him one day," writes
   Joutel, "when he was seized of a sudden with such a weakness that he could
   not stand, and was obliged to lie down on the ground. When he was a little
   better, I led him to a chamber of a house that the brothers Duhaut had
   hired. Here we put him to bed, and in the morning he was attacked by a
   violent fever."<a name="fnanchor_280" id="fnanchor_280"></a><a href="#footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> "It was so violent that," says another of his shipmates, "his
   imagination pictured to him things equally terrible and amazing."<a name="fnanchor_281" id="fnanchor_281"></a><a href="#footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
   He lay delirious in the wretched garret, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg
   369]</a></span> attended by his brother, and one or two others who stood
   faithful to him. A goldsmith of the neighborhood, moved at his deplorable
   condition, offered the use of his house; and Abb&eacute; Cavelier had
   him removed thither. But there was a tavern hard by, and the patient was
   tormented with daily and nightly riot. At the height of the fever, a party
   of Beaujeu's sailors spent a night in singing and dancing before the house;
   and, says Cavelier, "The more we begged them to be quiet, the more noise
   they made." La Salle lost reason and well-nigh life; but at length his
   mind resumed its balance, and the violence of the disease abated. A friendly
   Capucin friar offered him the shelter of his roof; and two of his men
   supported him thither on foot, giddy with exhaustion and hot with fever.
   Here he found repose, and was slowly recovering, when some of his attendants
   rashly told him the loss of the ketch "St. Fran&ccedil;ois;" and the consequence
   was a critical return of the disease.<a name="fnanchor_282" id="fnanchor_282"></a><a href="#footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>
<p>There was no one to fill his place. Beaujeu would not; Cavelier could
   not. Joutel, the gardener's son, was apparently the most trusty man of
   the company; but the expedition was virtually without a head. The men
   roamed on shore, and plunged into every excess of debauchery, contracting
   diseases which eventually killed them.</p>
<div class="sidenote">COMPLAINTS OF BEAUJEU.</div>
<p>Beaujeu, in the extremity of ill-humor, resumed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg
         370]</a></span> his correspondence with Seignelay. "But for the
         illness of the Sieur de la Salle," he writes, "I could not venture
         to report to you the progress of our voyage, as I am charged only
         with the navigation, and he with the secrets; but as his malady
         has deprived him of the use of his faculties, both of body and mind,
         I have thought myself obliged to acquaint you with what is passing,
         and of the condition in which we are."</p>
<p>He then declares that the ships freighted by La Salle were so slow that
   the "Joly" had continually been forced to wait for them, thus doubling
   the length of the voyage; that he had not had water enough for the passengers,
   as La Salle had not told him that there were to be any such till the day
   they came on board; that great numbers were sick, and that he had told
   La Salle there would be trouble if he filled all the space between decks
   with his goods, and forced the soldiers and sailors to sleep on deck;
   that he had told him he would get no provisions at St. Domingo, but that
   he insisted on stopping; that it had always been so,&mdash;that whatever
   he proposed La Salle would refuse, alleging orders from the King; "and
   now," pursues the ruffled commander, "everybody is ill; and he himself
   has a violent fever, as dangerous, the surgeon tells me, to the mind as
   to the body."</p>
<p>The rest of the letter is in the same strain. He says that a day or two
   after La Salle's illness began, his brother Cavelier came to ask him to
   take charge <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg
   371]</a></span> of his affairs; but that he did not wish to meddle with
   them, especially as nobody knows anything about them, and as La Salle
   has sold some of the ammunition and provisions; that Cavelier tells him
   that he thinks his brother keeps no accounts, wishing to hide his affairs
   from everybody; that he learns from buccaneers that the entrance of the
   Mississippi is very shallow and difficult, and that this is the worst
   season for navigating the Gulf; that the Spaniards have in these seas
   six vessels of from thirty to sixty guns each, besides row-galleys; but
   that he is not afraid, and will perish, or bring back an account of the
   Mississippi. "Nevertheless," he adds, "if the Sieur de la Salle dies,
   I shall pursue a course different from that which he has marked out; for
   I do not approve his plans."</p>
<p>"If," he continues, "you permit me to speak my mind, M. de la Salle ought
   to have been satisfied with discovering his river, without undertaking
   to conduct three vessels with troops two thousand leagues through so many
   different climates, and across seas entirely unknown to him. I grant that
   he is a man of knowledge, that he has reading, and even some tincture
   of navigation; but there is so much difference between theory and practice,
   that a man who has only the former will always be at fault. There is also
   a great difference between conducting canoes on lakes and along a river,
   and navigating ships with troops on distant oceans."<a name="fnanchor_283" id="fnanchor_283"></a><a href="#footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg

<p>While Beaujeu was complaining of La Salle, his followers were deserting
   him. It was necessary to send them on board ship, and keep them there;
   for there were French buccaneers at Petit Goave, who painted the promised
   land in such dismal colors that many of the adventurers completely lost
   heart. Some, too, were dying. "The air of this place is bad," says Joutel; "so
   are the fruits; and there are plenty of women worse than either."<a name="fnanchor_284" id="fnanchor_284"></a><a href="#footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>
<p>It was near the end of November before La Salle could resume the voyage.
   He was told that Beaujeu had said that he would not wait longer for the
   store-ship "Aimable," and that she might follow as she could.<a name="fnanchor_285" id="fnanchor_285"></a><a href="#footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Moreover,
   La Salle was on ill terms with Aigron, her captain, who had declared that
   he would have nothing more to do with him.<a name="fnanchor_286" id="fnanchor_286"></a><a href="#footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Fearing, therefore, that
   some mishap might befall her, he resolved to embark in her himself, with
   his brother Cavelier, Membr&eacute;, Douay, and others, the trustiest
   of his followers. On the twenty-fifth they set sail; the "Joly" and the
   little frigate "Belle" following. They coasted the shore of Cuba, and
   landed at the Isle of Pines, where La Salle shot an alligator, which the
   soldiers ate; and the hunter brought in a wild pig, half of which he sent
   to Beaujeu. Then they advanced to Cape St. Antoine, where bad weather
   and contrary winds long detained them. A load of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg
   373]</a></span> cares oppressed the mind of La Salle, pale and haggard
   with recent illness, wrapped within his own thoughts, and seeking sympathy
   from none.</p>
<div class="sidenote">A VAIN SEARCH.</div>
<p>At length they entered the Gulf of Mexico, that forbidden sea whence by
   a Spanish decree, dating from the reign of Philip II., all foreigners
   were excluded on pain of extermination.<a name="fnanchor_287" id="fnanchor_287"></a><a href="#footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Not a man on board knew the
   secrets of its perilous navigation. Cautiously feeling their way, they
   held a north-westerly course, till on the twenty-eighth of December a
   sailor at the mast-head of the "Aimable" saw land. La Salle and all the
   pilots had been led to form an exaggerated idea of the force of the easterly
   currents; and they therefore supposed themselves near the Bay of Appalache,
   when, in fact, they were much farther westward.</p>
<p>On New Year's Day they anchored three leagues from the shore. La Salle,
   with the engineer Minet, went to explore it, and found nothing but a vast
   marshy plain, studded with clumps of rushes. Two days after there was
   a thick fog, and when at length it cleared, the "Joly" was nowhere to
   be seen. La Salle in the "Aimable," followed closely by the little frigate "Belle," stood
   westward along the coast. When at the mouth of the Mississippi in 1682,
   he had taken its latitude, but unhappily could not determine its longitude;
   and now every eye on board was strained to detect in the monotonous lines <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg
   374]</a></span> of the low shore some tokens of the great river. In fact,
   they had already passed it. On the sixth of January, a wide opening was
   descried between two low points of land; and the adjacent sea was discolored
   with mud. "La Salle," writes his brother Cavelier, "has always thought
   that this was the Mississippi." To all appearance, it was the entrance
   of Galveston Bay.<a name="fnanchor_288" id="fnanchor_288"></a><a href="#footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> But why did he not examine it? Joutel says that
   his attempts to do so were frustrated by the objections of the pilot of
   the "Aimable," to which, with a facility very unusual with him, he suffered
   himself to yield. Cavelier declares, on the other hand, that he would
   not enter the opening because he was afraid of missing the "Joly." But
   he might have entered with one of his two vessels, while the other watched
   outside for the absent ship. From whatever cause, he lay here five or
   six days, waiting in vain for Beaujeu;<a name="fnanchor_289" id="fnanchor_289"></a><a href="#footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> till, at last, thinking that
   he must have passed westward, he resolved to follow. The "Aimable" and
   the "Belle" again spread their sails, and coasted the shores of Texas.
   Joutel, with a boat's crew, tried to land; but the sand-bars and breakers
   repelled him. A party of Indians swam out through the surf, and were taken
   on board; but La Salle could learn nothing from them, as their language
   was unknown to him. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg
   375]</a></span> Again Joutel tried to land, and again the breakers repelled
   him. He approached as near as he dared, and saw vast plains and a dim
   expanse of forest, buffalo running with their heavy gallop along the shore,
   and deer grazing on the marshy meadows.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE SHORES OF TEXAS.</div>
<p>Soon after, he succeeded in landing at a point somewhere between Matagorda
   Island and Corpus Christi Bay. The aspect of the country was not cheering,
   with its barren plains, its reedy marshes, its interminable oyster-beds,
   and broad flats of mud bare at low tide. Joutel and his men sought in
   vain for fresh water, and after shooting some geese and ducks returned
   to the "Aimable." Nothing had been seen of Beaujeu and the "Joly;" the
   coast was trending southward; and La Salle, convinced that he must have
   passed the missing ship, turned to retrace his course. He had sailed but
   a few miles when the wind failed, a fog covered the sea, and he was forced
   to anchor opposite one of the openings into the lagoons north of Mustang
   Island. At length, on the nineteenth, there came a faint breeze; the mists
   rolled away before it, and to his great joy he saw the "Joly" approaching.</p>
<p>"His joy," says Joutel, "was short." Beaujeu's lieutenant, Aire, came
   on board to charge him with having caused the separation, and La Salle
   retorted by throwing the blame on Beaujeu. Then came a debate as to their
   position. The priest Esmanville was present, and reports that La Salle
   seemed greatly perplexed. He had more cause for perplexity than <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg
   376]</a></span> he knew; for in his ignorance of the longitude of the
   Mississippi, he had sailed more than four hundred miles beyond it.</p>
<p>Of this he had not the faintest suspicion. In full sight from his ship
   lay a reach of those vast lagoons which, separated from the sea by narrow
   strips of land, line this coast with little interruption from Galveston
   Bay to the Rio Grande. The idea took possession of him that the Mississippi
   discharged itself into these lagoons, and thence made its way to the sea
   through the various openings he had seen along the coast, chief among
   which was that he had discovered on the sixth, about fifty leagues from
   the place where he now was.<a name="fnanchor_290" id="fnanchor_290"></a><a href="#footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">PERPLEXITY OF LA SALLE.</div>
<p>Yet he was full of doubt as to what he should do. Four days after rejoining
   Beaujeu, he wrote him the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg
   377]</a></span> strange request to land the troops, that he "might fulfil
   his commission;" that is, that he might set out against the Spaniards.<a name="fnanchor_291" id="fnanchor_291"></a><a href="#footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
   More than a week passed, a gale had set in, and nothing was done. Then
   La Salle wrote again, intimating some doubt as to whether he was really
   at one of the mouths of the Mississippi, and saying that, being sure that
   he had passed the principal mouth, he was determined to go back to look
   for it.<a name="fnanchor_292" id="fnanchor_292"></a><a href="#footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> Meanwhile, Beaujeu was in a state of great irritation. The
   weather was stormy, and the coast was dangerous. Supplies were scanty;
   and La Salle's soldiers, still crowded in the "Joly," were consuming the
   provisions of the ship. Beaujeu gave vent to his annoyance, and La Salle
   retorted in the same strain.</p>
<p>According to Joutel, he urged the naval commander to sail back in search
   of the river; and Beaujeu refused, unless La Salle should give the soldiers
   provisions. La Salle, he adds, offered to supply them with rations for
   fifteen days; and Beaujeu declared this insufficient. There is reason,
   however, to believe that the request was neither made by the one nor refused
   by the other so positively as here appears.</p>

      of Galveston Bay, mistaken by him for the chief outlet of the Mississippi.
      It is evident that he imagined Galveston Bay to form a part of the
      chain of lagoons from which it is in fact separated. He speaks of these
      lagoons as "une esp&egrave;ce de baye fort longue et fort large, <i>dans

      sight, was the open sea. <i>Lettre de La Salle au Ministre, 4 Mars,

<p><span class="smcap">Impatience</span> to rid himself of his colleague and to command alone no doubt
   had its influence on the judgment of La Salle. He presently declared that
   he would land the soldiers, and send them along shore till they came to
   the principal outlet of the river. On this, the engineer Minet took up
   the word,&mdash;expressed his doubts as to whether the Mississippi discharged
   itself into the lagoons at all; represented that even if it did, the soldiers
   would be exposed to great risks; and gave as his opinion that all should
   reimbark and continue the search in company. The advice was good, but
   La Salle resented it as coming from one in whom he recognized no right
   to give it. "He treated me," complains the engineer, "as if I were the
   meanest of mankind."<a name="fnanchor_293" id="fnanchor_293"></a><a href="#footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg

<p>He persisted in his purpose, and sent Joutel and Moranget with a party
   of soldiers to explore the coast. They made their way northeastward along
   the shore of Matagorda Island, till they were stopped on the third day
   by what Joutel calls a river, but which was in fact the entrance of Matagorda
   Bay. Here they encamped, and tried to make a raft of drift-wood. "The
   difficulty was," says Joutel, "our great number of men, and the few of
   them who were fit for anything except eating. As I said before, they had
   all been caught by force or surprise, so that our company was like Noah's
   ark, which contained animals of all sorts." Before their raft was finished,
   they descried to their great joy the ships which had followed them along
   the coast.<a name="fnanchor_294" id="fnanchor_294"></a><a href="#footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">LANDING OF LA SALLE.</div>
<p>La Salle landed, and announced that here was the western mouth of the
   Mississippi, and the place to which the King had sent him. He said further
   that he would land all his men, and bring the "Aimable" and the "Belle" to
   the safe harborage within. Beaujeu remonstrated, alleging the shallowness
   of the water and the force of the currents; but his remonstrance was vain.<a name="fnanchor_295" id="fnanchor_295"></a><a href="#footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>
<p>The Bay of St. Louis, now Matagorda Bay, forms a broad and sheltered harbor,
   accessible from the sea by a narrow passage, obstructed by sand-bars and
   by the small island now called Pelican Island. Boats <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg
   380]</a></span> were sent to sound and buoy out the channel, and this
   was successfully accomplished on the sixteenth of February. The "Aimable" was
   ordered to enter; and, on the twentieth, she weighed anchor. La Salle
   was on shore watching her. A party of men, at a little distance, were
   cutting down a tree to make a canoe. Suddenly some of them ran towards
   him with terrified faces, crying out that they had been set upon by a
   troop of Indians, who had seized their companions and carried them off.
   La Salle ordered those about him to take their arms, and at once set out
   in pursuit. He overtook the Indians, and opened a parley with them; but
   when he wished to reclaim his men, he discovered that they had been led
   away during the conference to the Indian camp, a league and a half distant.
   Among them was one of his lieutenants, the young Marquis de la Sablonni&egrave;re.
   He was deeply vexed, for the moment was critical; but the men must be
   recovered, and he led his followers in haste towards the camp. Yet he
   could not refrain from turning a moment to watch the "Aimable," as she
   neared the shoals; and he remarked with deep anxiety to Joutel, who was
   with him, that if she held that course she would soon be aground.</p>
<div class="sidenote">WRECK OF THE "AIMABLE".</div>
<p>They hurried on till they saw the Indian huts. About fifty of them, oven-shaped,
   and covered with mats and hides, were clustered on a rising ground, with
   their inmates gathered among and around them. As the French entered the
   camp, there was the report <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg
   381]</a></span> of a cannon from the seaward. The startled savages dropped
   flat with terror. A different fear seized La Salle, for he knew that the
   shot was a signal of disaster. Looking back, he saw the "Aimable" furling
   her sails, and his heart sank with the conviction that she had struck
   upon the reef. Smothering his distress,&mdash;she was laden with all the
   stores of the colony,&mdash;he pressed forward among the filthy wigwams,
   whose astonished inmates swarmed about the band of armed strangers, staring
   between curiosity and fear. La Salle knew those with whom he was dealing,
   and, without ceremony, entered the chief's lodge with his followers. The
   crowd closed around them, naked men and half-naked women, described by
   Joutel as of singular ugliness. They gave buffalo meat and dried porpoise
   to the unexpected guests, but La Salle, racked with anxiety, hastened
   to close the interview; and having without difficulty recovered the kidnapped
   men, he returned to the beach, leaving with the Indians, as usual, an
   impression of good-will and respect.</p>
<p>When he reached the shore, he saw his worst fears realized. The "Aimable" lay
   careened over on the reef, hopelessly aground. Little remained but to
   endure the calamity with firmness, and to save, as far as might be, the
   vessel's cargo. This was no easy task. The boat which hung at her stern
   had been stove in,&mdash;it is said, by design. Beaujeu sent a boat from
   the "Joly," and one or more Indian pirogues were procured. La Salle urged
   on his men <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span> with
   stern and patient energy, and a quantity of gunpowder and flour was safely
   landed. But now the wind blew fresh from the sea; the waves began to rise;
   a storm came on; the vessel, rocking to and fro on the sand-bar, opened
   along her side, and the ravenous waves were strewn with her treasures.
   When the confusion was at its height, a troop of Indians came down to
   the shore, greedy for plunder. The drum was beat; the men were called
   to arms; La Salle set his trustiest followers to guard the gunpowder,
   in fear, not of the Indians alone, but of his own countrymen. On that
   lamentable night, the sentinels walked their rounds through the dreary
   bivouac among the casks, bales, and boxes which the sea had yielded up;
   and here, too, their fate-hunted chief held his drearier vigil, encompassed
   with treachery, darkness, and the storm.</p>
<p>Not only La Salle, but Joutel and others of his party, believed that the
   wreck of the "Aimable" was intentional. Aigron, who commanded her, had
   disobeyed orders and disregarded signals. Though he had been directed
   to tow the vessel through the channel, he went in under sail; and though
   little else was saved from the wreck, his personal property, including
   even some preserved fruits, was all landed safely. He had long been on
   ill terms with La Salle.<a name="fnanchor_296" id="fnanchor_296"></a><a href="#footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg
   383]</a></span></p>
<p>All La Salle's company were now encamped on the sands at the left side
   of the inlet where the "Aimable" was wrecked.<a name="fnanchor_297" id="fnanchor_297"></a><a href="#footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> "They were all," says
   the engineer Minet, "sick with nausea and dysentery. Five or six died
   every day, in consequence of brackish water and bad food. There was no
   grass, but plenty of rushes and plenty of oysters. There was nothing to
   make ovens, so that they had to eat flour saved from the wreck, boiled
   into messes of porridge with this brackish water. Along the shore were
   quantities of uprooted trees and rotten logs, thrown up by the sea and
   the lagoon." Of these, and fragments of the wreck, they made a sort of
   rampart to protect their camp; and here, among tents and hovels, bales,
   boxes, casks, spars, dismounted cannon, and pens for fowls and swine,
   were gathered the dejected men and homesick women who were to seize New
   Biscay, and hold for France a region large as half Europe. The Spaniards,
   whom they were to conquer, were they <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg
   384]</a></span> knew not where. They knew not where they were themselves;
   and for the fifteen thousand Indian allies who were to have joined them,
   they found two hundred squalid savages, more like enemies than friends.</p>
<p>In fact, it was soon made plain that these their neighbors wished them
   no good. A few days after the wreck, the prairie was seen on fire. As
   the smoke and flame rolled towards them before the wind, La Salle caused
   all the grass about the camp to be cut and carried away, and especially
   around the spot where the powder was placed. The danger was averted; but
   it soon became known that the Indians had stolen a number of blankets
   and other articles, and carried them to their wigwams. Unwilling to leave
   his camp, La Salle sent his nephew Moranget and several other volunteers,
   with a party of men, to reclaim them. They went up the bay in a boat,
   landed at the Indian camp, and, with more mettle than discretion, marched
   into it, sword in hand. The Indians ran off, and the rash adventurers
   seized upon several canoes as an equivalent for the stolen goods. Not
   knowing how to manage them, they made slow progress on their way back,
   and were overtaken by night before reaching the French camp. They landed,
   made a fire, placed a sentinel, and lay down on the dry grass to sleep.
   The sentinel followed their example, when suddenly they were awakened
   by the war-whoop and a shower of arrows. Two volunteers, Oris and Desloges,
   were killed on the spot; a third, named Gayen, was severely <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg
   385]</a></span> wounded; and young Moranget received an arrow through
   the arm. He leaped up and fired his gun at the vociferous but invisible
   foe. Others of the party did the same, and the Indians fled.</p>
<div class="sidenote">BEAUJEU AND LA SALLE.</div>
<p>It was about this time that Beaujeu prepared to return to France. He had
   accomplished his mission, and landed his passengers at what La Salle assured
   him to be one of the mouths of the Mississippi. His ship was in danger
   on this exposed and perilous coast, and he was anxious to find shelter.
   For some time past, his relations with La Salle had been amicable, and
   it was agreed between them that Beaujeu should stop at Galveston Bay,
   the supposed chief mouth of the Mississippi; or, failing to find harborage
   here, that he should proceed to Mobile Bay, and wait there till April,
   to hear from his colleague. Two days before the wreck of the "Aimable," he
   wrote to La Salle: "I wish with all my heart that you would have more
   confidence in me. For my part, I will always make the first advances;
   and I will follow your counsel whenever I can do so without risking my
   ship. I will come back to this place, if you want to know the results
   of the voyage I am going to make. If you wish, I will go to Martinique
   for provisions and reinforcements. In fine, there is nothing I am not
   ready to do: you have only to speak."</p>
<p>La Salle had begged him to send ashore a number of cannon and a quantity
   of iron, stowed in the "Joly," for the use of the colony; and Beaujeu
   replies: "I wish very much that I could give you <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg
   386]</a></span> your iron, but it is impossible except in a harbor; for
   it is on my ballast, and under your cannon, my spare anchors, and all
   my stowage. It would take three days to get it out, which cannot be done
   in this place, where the sea runs like mountains when the slightest wind
   blows outside. I would rather come back to give it to you, in case you
   do not send the 'Belle' to Baye du St. Esprit [Mobile Bay] to get it....
   I beg you once more to consider the offer I make you to go to Martinique
   to get provisions for your people. I will ask the intendant for them in
   your name; and if they are refused, I will take them on my own account."<a name="fnanchor_298" id="fnanchor_298"></a><a href="#footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>
<p>To this La Salle immediately replied: "I received with singular pleasure
   the letter you took the trouble to write me; for I found in it extraordinary
   proofs of kindness in the interest you take in the success of an affair
   which I have the more at heart, as it involves the glory of the King and
   the honor of Monseigneur de Seignelay. I have done my part towards a perfect
   understanding between us, and have never been wanting in confidence; but
   even if I could be so, the offers you make are so obliging that they would
   inspire complete trust." He nevertheless declines them,&mdash;assuring
   Beaujeu at the same time that he has reached the place he sought, and
   is in a fair way of success if he can but have the cannon, cannonballs,
   and iron stowed on board the "Joly."<a name="fnanchor_299" id="fnanchor_299"></a><a href="#footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg
   387]</a></span></p>
<p>Directly after he writes again, "I cannot help conjuring you once more
   to try to give us the iron." Beaujeu replies: "To show you how ardently
   I wish to contribute to the success of your undertaking, I have ordered
   your iron to be got out, in spite of my officers and sailors, who tell
   me that I endanger my ship by moving everything in the depth of the hold
   on a coast like this, where the seas are like mountains. I hesitated to
   disturb my stowage, not so much to save trouble as because no ballast
   is to be got hereabout; and I have therefore had six cannon, from my lower
   deck battery, let down into the hold to take the place of the iron." And
   he again urges La Salle to accept his offer to bring provisions to the
   colonists from Martinique.</p>
<div class="sidenote">DEPARTURE OF BEAUJEU.</div>
<p>On the next day, the "Aimable" was wrecked. Beaujeu remained a fortnight
   longer on the coast, and then told La Salle that being out of wood, water,
   and other necessaries, he must go to Mobile Bay to get them. Nevertheless,
   he lingered a week more, repeated his offer to bring supplies from Martinique,
   which La Salle again refused, and at last set sail on the twelfth of March,
   after a leave-taking which was courteous on both sides.<a name="fnanchor_300" id="fnanchor_300"></a><a href="#footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>
<p>La Salle and his colonists were left alone. Several of them had lost heart,
   and embarked for home with Beaujeu. Among these was Minet the engineer,
   who had fallen out with La Salle, and who when he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg
   388]</a></span> reached France was imprisoned for deserting him. Even
   his brother, the priest Jean Cavelier, had a mind to abandon the enterprise,
   but was persuaded at last to remain, along with his nephew the hot-headed
   Moranget, and the younger Cavelier, a mere school-boy. The two R&eacute;collet
   friars, Zenobe Membr&eacute; and Anastase Douay, the trusty Joutel, a
   man of sense and observation, and the Marquis de la Sablonni&egrave;re,
   a debauched noble whose patrimony was his sword, were now the chief persons
   of the forlorn company. The rest were soldiers, raw and undisciplined,
   and artisans, most of whom knew nothing of their vocation. Add to these
   the miserable families and the infatuated young women who had come to
   tempt fortune in the swamps and cane-brakes of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>La Salle set out to explore the neighborhood. Joutel remained in command
   of the so-called fort. He was beset with wily enemies, and often at night
   the Indians would crawl in the grass around his feeble stockade, howling
   like wolves; but a few shots would put them to flight. A strict guard
   was kept; and a wooden horse was set in the enclosure, to punish the sentinel
   who should sleep at his post. They stood in daily fear of a more formidable
   foe, and once they saw a sail, which they doubted not was Spanish; but
   she happily passed without discovering them. They hunted on the prairies,
   and speared fish in the neighboring pools. On Easter Day, the Sieur le
   Gros, one of the chief men of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg
   389]</a></span> company, went out after the service to shoot snipes; but
   as he walked barefoot through the marsh, a snake bit him, and he soon
   after died. Two men deserted, to starve on the prairie, or to become savages
   among savages. Others tried to escape, but were caught; and one of them
   was hung. A knot of desperadoes conspired to kill Joutel; but one of them
   betrayed the secret, and the plot was crushed.</p>
<p>La Salle returned from his exploration, but his return brought no cheer.
   He had been forced to renounce the illusion to which he had clung so long,
   and was convinced at last that he was not at the mouth of the Mississippi.
   The wreck of the "Aimable" itself was not pregnant with consequences so
   disastrous.</p>
<div class="sidenote">CONDUCT OF BEAUJEU.</div>
<p class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The
conduct of Beaujeu, hitherto judged chiefly by the printed narrative of Joutel, is set in
a new and more favorable light by his correspondence with La Salle.
Whatever may have been their mutual irritation, it is clear that
the naval commander was anxious to discharge his duty in a manner
to satisfy Seignelay, and that he may be wholly acquitted of any
sinister design. When he left La Salle on the twelfth of March,
he meant to sail in search of the Bay of Mobile (Baye du St. Esprit),&mdash;partly
because he hoped to find it a safe harbor, where he could
get La Salle's cannon out of the hold and find ballast to take their
place; and partly to get a supply of wood and water, of which he
was in extreme need. He told La Salle that he would wait there
till the middle of April, in order that he (La Salle) might send the "Belle" to
receive the cannon; but on this point there was no
definite agreement between them. Beaujeu was ignorant of the position
of the bay, which he thought much nearer than it actually was.
After trying two days to reach it, the strong head-winds and the
discontent of his crew induced him to bear away for Cuba; and
after an encounter with pirates and various adventures, he reached
France about the first of July. He was coldly received by Seignelay,
who wrote to the
 <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
intendant at Rochelle: "His Majesty has
seen what you wrote about the idea of the Sieur de Beaujeu, that
the Sieur de la Salle is not at the mouth of the Mississippi. He seems
to found this belief on such weak conjectures that no great attention
need be given to his account, especially as <i>this man</i> has
been prejudiced from the first against La Salle's enterprise." (<i>Lettre
de Seignelay &agrave; Arnoul, 22 Juillet,</i> 1685. Margry,
ii. 604.) The minister at the same time warns Beaujeu to say nothing
in disparagement of the enterprise, under pain of the King's
displeasure. The narrative of the engineer, Minet,
sufficiently explains a curious map, made by him, as he says,
not on the spot, but on the voyage homeward, and still preserved
in the Archives Scientifiques de la Marine. This map includes two
distinct sketches of the mouth of the Mississippi. The first, which
corresponds to that made by Franquelin in 1684, is entitled "Embouchure
de la Rivi&egrave;re comme M. de la Salle la marque dans sa Carte." The
second bears the words, "Costes et Lacs par la Hauteur de sa
Rivi&egrave;re, comme nous les avons trouv&eacute;s." These "Costes et Lacs" are
a rude representation of the lagoons of Matagorda Bay and its neighborhood,
into which the Mississippi is made to discharge, in
accordance with the belief of La Salle. A portion of the coast-line
is drawn from actual, though superficial observation. The rest is
merely conjectural.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> what avail to plant a colony by the mouth of a petty Texan river? The
   Mississippi was the life of the enterprise, the condition of its growth
   and of its existence. Without it, all was futile and meaningless,&mdash;a
   folly and a ruin. Cost what it might, the Mississippi must be found.</p>
<p>But the demands of the hour were imperative. The hapless colony, cast
   ashore like a wreck on the sands of Matagorda Bay, must gather up its
   shattered resources and recruit its exhausted strength, before it essayed
   anew its pilgrimage to the "fatal river." La Salle during his explorations
   had found a spot which he thought well fitted for a temporary establishment.
   It was on the river which he named the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg
   392]</a></span> La Vache,<a name="fnanchor_301" id="fnanchor_301"></a><a href="#footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> now the Lavaca, which enters the head of
   Matagorda Bay; and thither he ordered all the women and children, and
   most of the men, to remove; while the rest, thirty in number, remained
   with Joutel at the fort near the mouth of the bay. Here they spent their
   time in hunting, fishing, and squaring the logs of drift-wood which the
   sea washed up in abundance, and which La Salle proposed to use in building
   his new station on the Lavaca. Thus the time passed till midsummer, when
   Joutel received orders to abandon his post, and rejoin the main body of
   the colonists. To this end, the little frigate "Belle" was sent down the
   bay. She was a gift from the King to La Salle, who had brought her safely
   over the bar, and regarded her as a main-stay of his hopes. She now took
   on board the stores and some of the men, while Joutel with the rest followed
   along shore to the post on the Lavaca. Here he found a state of things
   that was far from cheering. Crops had been sown, but the drought and the
   cattle had nearly destroyed them. The colonists were lodged under tents
   and hovels; and the only solid structure was a small square enclosure
   of pickets, in which the gunpowder and the brandy were stored. The site
   was good, a rising ground by the river; but there was no wood within the
   distance of a league, and no horses or oxen to drag it. Their work must
   be done by men. Some felled and squared the timber; and others dragged
   it by main force over the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg
   393]</a></span> matted grass of the prairie, under the scorching Texan
   sun. The gun-carriages served to make the task somewhat easier; yet the
   strongest men soon gave out under it. Joutel went down to the first fort,
   made a raft and brought up the timber collected there, which proved a
   most seasonable and useful supply. Palisades and buildings began to rise.
   The men labored without spirit, yet strenuously; for they labored under
   the eye of La Salle. The carpenters brought from Rochelle proved worthless;
   and he himself made the plans of the work, marked out the tenons and mortises,
   and directed the whole.<a name="fnanchor_302" id="fnanchor_302"></a><a href="#footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">MISERY AND DEJECTION.</div>
<p>Death, meanwhile, made withering havoc among his followers; and under
   the sheds and hovels that shielded them from the sun lay a score of wretches
   slowly wasting away with the diseases contracted at St. Domingo. Of the
   soldiers enlisted for the expedition by La Salle's agents, many are affirmed
   to have spent their lives in begging at the church doors of Rochefort,
   and were consequently incapable of discipline. It was impossible to prevent
   either them or the sailors from devouring persimmons and other wild fruits
   to a destructive excess. Nearly all fell ill; and before the summer had
   passed, the graveyard had more than thirty tenants.<a name="fnanchor_303" id="fnanchor_303"></a><a href="#footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> The bearing of
   La Salle did not aid to raise the drooping spirits of his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg
   394]</a></span> followers. The results of the enterprise had been far
   different from his hopes; and, after a season of flattering promise, he
   had entered again on those dark and obstructed paths which seemed his
   destined way of life. The present was beset with trouble; the future,
   thick with storms. The consciousness quickened his energies; but it made
   him stern, harsh, and often unjust to those beneath him.</p>
<p>Joutel was returning to camp one afternoon with the master-carpenter,
   when they saw game; and the carpenter went after it. He was never seen
   again. Perhaps he was lost on the prairie, perhaps killed by Indians.
   He knew little of his trade, but they nevertheless had need of him. Le
   Gros, a man of character and intelligence, suffered more and more from
   the bite of the snake received in the marsh on Easter Day. The injured
   limb was amputated, and he died. La Salle's brother, the priest, lay ill;
   and several others among the chief persons of the colony were in the same
   condition.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the work was urged on. A large building was finished, constructed
   of timber, roofed with boards and raw hides, and divided into apartments
   for lodging and other uses. La Salle gave the new establishment his favorite
   name of Fort St. Louis, and the neighboring bay was also christened after
   the royal saint.<a name="fnanchor_304" id="fnanchor_304"></a><a href="#footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> The scene was not without <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg
   395]</a></span> its charms. Towards the southeast stretched the bay with
   its bordering meadows; and on the northeast the Lavaca ran along the base
   of green declivities. Around, far and near, rolled a sea of prairie, with
   distant forests, dim in the summer haze. At times, it was dotted with
   the browsing buffalo, not yet scared from their wonted pastures; and the
   grassy swells were spangled with the flowers for which Texas is renowned,
   and which now form the gay ornaments of our gardens.</p>
<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE'S EXPLORATIONS.</div>
<p>And now, the needful work accomplished, and the colony in some measure
   housed and fortified, its indefatigable chief prepared to renew his quest
   of the "fatal river," as Joutel repeatedly calls it. Before his departure
   he made some preliminary explorations, in the course of which, according
   to the report of his brother the priest, he found evidence that the Spaniards
   had long before had a transient establishment at a spot about fifteen
   leagues from Fort St. Louis.<a name="fnanchor_305" id="fnanchor_305"></a><a href="#footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg
   396]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">LIFE AT THE FORT.</div>
<p>It was the last day of October when La Salle set out on his great journey
   of exploration. His brother Cavelier, who had now recovered, accompanied
   him with fifty men; and five cannon-shot from the fort saluted them as
   they departed. They were lightly equipped; but some of them wore corselets
   made of staves, to ward off arrows. Descending the Lavaca, they pursued
   their course eastward on foot along the margin of the bay, while Joutel
   remained in command of the fort. It was two leagues above the mouth of
   the river; and in it were thirty-four persons, including three R&eacute;collet
   friars, a number of women and girls from Paris, and two young orphan daughters
   of one Talon, a Canadian, who had lately died. Their live-stock consisted
   of some hogs and a litter of eight pigs, which, as Joutel does not forget
   to inform us, passed their time in wallowing in the ditch of the palisade;
   a cock and hen, with a young family; and a pair of goats, which, in a
   temporary dearth of fresh meat, were sacrificed to the needs of the invalid
   Abb&eacute; Cavelier. Joutel suffered no man to lie idle. The blacksmith,
   having no anvil, was supplied with a cannon as a substitute. Lodgings
   were built for the women and girls, and separate lodgings for the men.
   A small chapel was afterwards added, and the whole was fenced with a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg
   397]</a></span> palisade. At the four corners of the house were mounted
   eight pieces of cannon, which, in the absence of balls, were loaded with
   bags of bullets.<a name="fnanchor_306" id="fnanchor_306"></a><a href="#footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> Between the palisades and the stream lay a narrow
   strip of marsh, the haunt of countless birds; and at a little distance
   it deepened into pools full of fish. All the surrounding prairies swarmed
   with game,&mdash;buffalo, deer, hares, turkeys, ducks, geese, swans, plover,
   snipe, and grouse. The river supplied the colonists with turtles, and
   the bay with oysters. Of these last, they often found more than they wanted;
   for when in their excursions they shoved their log canoes into the water,
   wading shoeless through the deep, tenacious mud, the sharp shells would
   cut their feet like knives; "and what was worse," says Joutel, "the salt
   water came into the gashes, and made them smart atrociously."</p>
<p>He sometimes amused himself with shooting alligators. "I never spared
   them when I met them near the house. One day I killed an extremely large
   one, which was nearly four feet and a half in girth, and about twenty
   feet long." He describes with accuracy that curious native of the southwestern
   plains, the "horned frog," which, deceived by its uninviting appearance,
   he erroneously supposed to be venomous. "We had some of our animals bitten
   by snakes; among the others, a bitch that had belonged to the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg
   398]</a></span> deceased Sieur le Gros. She was bitten in the jaw when
   she was with me, as I was fishing by the shore of the bay. I gave her
   a little theriac [an antidote then in vogue], which cured her, as it did
   one of our sows, which came home one day with her head so swelled that
   she could hardly hold it up. Thinking it must be some snake that had bitten
   her, I gave her a dose of the theriac mixed with meal and water." The
   patient began to mend at once. "I killed a good many rattle-snakes by
   means of the aforesaid bitch, for when she saw one she would bark around
   him, sometimes for a half hour together, till I took my gun and shot him.
   I often found them in the bushes, making a noise with their tails. When
   I had killed them, our hogs ate them." He devotes many pages to the plants
   and animals of the neighborhood, most of which may easily be recognized
   from his description.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE BUFFALO.</div>
<p>With the buffalo, which he calls "our daily bread," his experiences were
   many and strange. Being, like the rest of the party, a novice in the art
   of shooting them, he met with many disappointments. Once, having mounted
   to the roof of the large house in the fort, he saw a dark moving object
   on a swell of the prairie three miles off; and rightly thinking that it
   was a herd of buffalo, he set out with six or seven men to try to kill
   some of them. After a while, he discovered two bulls lying in a hollow;
   and signing to the rest of his party to keep quiet, he made his approach,
   gun in hand. The bulls presently jumped <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg
   399]</a></span> up, and stared through their manes at the intruder. Joutel
   fired. It was a close shot; but the bulls merely shook their shaggy heads,
   wheeled about, and galloped heavily away. The same luck attended him the
   next day. "We saw plenty of buffalo. I approached several bands of them,
   and fired again and again, but could not make one of them fall." He had
   not yet learned that a buffalo rarely falls at once, unless hit in the
   spine. He continues: "I was not discouraged; and after approaching several
   more bands,&mdash;which was hard work, because I had to crawl on the ground,
   so as not to be seen,&mdash;I found myself in a herd of five or six thousand,
   but, to my great vexation, I could not bring one of them down. They all
   ran off to the right and left. It was near night, and I had killed nothing.
   Though I was very tired, I tried again, approached another band, and fired
   a number of shots; but not a buffalo would fall. The skin was off my knees
   with crawling. At last, as I was going back to rejoin our men, I saw a
   buffalo lying on the ground. I went towards it, and saw that it was dead.
   I examined it, and found that the bullet had gone in near the shoulder.
   Then I found others dead like the first. I beckoned the men to come on,
   and we set to work to cut up the meat,&mdash;a task which was new to us
   all." It would be impossible to write a more true and characteristic sketch
   of the experience of a novice in shooting buffalo on foot. A few days
   after, he went out again, with Father Anastase Douay; approached a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg
   400]</a></span> bull, fired, and broke his shoulder. The bull hobbled
   off on three legs. Douay ran in his cassock to head him back, while Joutel
   reloaded his gun; upon which the enraged beast butted at the missionary,
   and knocked him down. He very narrowly escaped with his life. "There was
   another missionary," pursues Joutel, "named Father Maxime Le Clerc, who
   was very well fitted for such an undertaking as ours, because he was equal
   to anything, even to butchering a buffalo; and as I said before that every
   one of us must lend a hand, because we were too few for anybody to be
   waited upon, I made the women, girls, and children do their part, as well
   as him; for as they all wanted to eat, it was fair that they all should
   work." He had a scaffolding built near the fort, and set them to smoking
   buffalo meat, against a day of scarcity.<a name="fnanchor_307" id="fnanchor_307"></a><a href="#footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">RETURN OF DUHAUT.</div>
<p>Thus the time passed till the middle of January; when late one evening,
   as all were gathered in the principal building, conversing perhaps, or
   smoking, or playing at cards, or dozing by the fire in homesick dreams
   of France, a man on guard came in to report that he had heard a voice
   from the river. They all went down to the bank, and descried a man in
   a canoe, who called out, "Dominic!" This was the name of the younger of
   the two brothers Duhaut, who was one of Joutel's followers. As the canoe <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg
   401]</a></span> approached, they recognized the elder, who had gone with
   La Salle on his journey of discovery, and who was perhaps the greatest
   villain of the company. Joutel was much perplexed. La Salle had ordered
   him to admit nobody into the fort without a pass and a watchword. Duhaut,
   when questioned, said that he had none, but told at the same time so plausible
   a story that Joutel no longer hesitated to receive him. As La Salle and
   his men were pursuing their march along the prairie, Duhaut, who was in
   the rear, had stopped to mend his moccasins, and when he tried to overtake
   the party, had lost his way, mistaking a buffalo-path for the trail of
   his companions. At night he fired his gun as a signal, but there was no
   answering shot. Seeing no hope of rejoining them, he turned back for the
   fort, found one of the canoes which La Salle had hidden at the shore,
   paddled by night and lay close by day, shot turkeys, deer, and buffalo
   for food, and, having no knife, cut the meat with a sharp flint, till
   after a month of excessive hardship he reached his destination. As the
   inmates of Fort St. Louis gathered about the weather-beaten wanderer,
   he told them dreary tidings. The pilot of the "Belle," such was his story,
   had gone with five men to sound along the shore, by order of La Salle,
   who was then encamped in the neighborhood with his party of explorers.
   The boat's crew, being overtaken by the night, had rashly bivouacked on
   the beach without setting a guard; and as they slept, a band of Indians
   had rushed in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg
   402]</a></span> upon them, and butchered them all. La Salle, alarmed by
   their long absence, had searched along the shore, and at length found
   their bodies scattered about the sands and half-devoured by wolves.<a name="fnanchor_308" id="fnanchor_308"></a><a href="#footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
   Well would it have been, if Duhaut had shared their fate.</p>
<p>Weeks and months dragged on, when, at the end of March, Joutel, chancing
   to mount on the roof of one of the buildings, saw seven or eight men approaching
   over the prairie. He went out to meet them with an equal number, well
   armed; and as he drew near recognized, with mixed joy and anxiety, La
   Salle and some of those who had gone with him. His brother Cavelier was
   at his side, with his cassock so tattered that, says Joutel, "there was
   hardly a piece left large enough to wrap a farthing's worth of salt. He
   had an old cap on his head, having lost his hat by the way. The rest were
   in no better plight, for their shirts were all in rags. Some of them carried
   loads of meat, because M. de la Salle was afraid that we might not have
   killed any buffalo. We met with great joy and many embraces. After our
   greetings were over, M. de la Salle, seeing Duhaut, asked me in an angry
   tone how it was that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg
   403]</a></span> I had received this man who had abandoned him. I told
   him how it had happened, and repeated Duhaut's story. Duhaut defended
   himself, and M. de la Salle's anger was soon over. We went into the house,
   and refreshed ourselves with some bread and brandy, as there was no wine
   left."<a name="fnanchor_309" id="fnanchor_309"></a><a href="#footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE'S ADVENTURES.</div>
<p>La Salle and his companions told their story. They had wandered on through
   various savage tribes, with whom they had more than one encounter, scattering
   them like chaff by the terror of their fire-arms. At length they found
   a more friendly band, and learned much touching the Spaniards, who, they
   were told, were universally hated by the tribes of that country. It would
   be easy, said their informants, to gather a host of warriors and lead
   them over the Rio Grande; but La Salle was in no condition for attempting
   conquests, and the tribes in whose alliance he had trusted had, a few
   days before, been at blows with him. The invasion of New Biscay must be
   postponed to a more propitious day. Still advancing, he came to a large
   river, which he at first mistook for the Mississippi; and building a fort
   of palisades, he left here several of his men.<a name="fnanchor_310" id="fnanchor_310"></a><a href="#footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> The fate of these
   unfortunates does not appear. He <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg
   404]</a></span> now retraced his steps towards Fort St. Louis, and, as
   he approached it, detached some of his men to look for his vessel, the "Belle," for
   whose safety, since the loss of her pilot, he had become very anxious.</p>
<p>On the next day these men appeared at the fort, with downcast looks. They
   had not found the "Belle" at the place where she had been ordered to remain,
   nor were any tidings to be heard of her. From that hour, the conviction
   that she was lost possessed the mind of La Salle. Surrounded as he was,
   and had always been, with traitors, the belief now possessed him that
   her crew had abandoned the colony, and made sail for the West Indies or
   for France. The loss was incalculable. He had relied on this vessel to
   transport the colonists to the Mississippi, as soon as its exact position
   could be ascertained; and thinking her a safer place of deposit than the
   fort, he had put on board of her all his papers and personal baggage,
   besides a great quantity of stores, ammunition, and tools.<a name="fnanchor_311" id="fnanchor_311"></a><a href="#footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> In truth,
   she was of the last necessity to the unhappy exiles, and their only resource
   for escape from a position which was fast becoming desperate.</p>
<p>La Salle, as his brother tells us, now fell dangerously ill,&mdash;the
   fatigues of his journey, joined to the effects upon his mind of this last
   disaster, having overcome his strength, though not his fortitude. "In
   truth," writes the priest, "after the loss of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg
   405]</a></span> vessel which deprived us of our only means of returning
   to France, we had no resource but in the firm guidance of my brother,
   whose death each of us would have regarded as his own."<a name="fnanchor_312" id="fnanchor_312"></a><a href="#footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">DEPARTURE FOR CANADA.</div>
<p>La Salle no sooner recovered than he embraced a resolution which could
   be the offspring only of a desperate necessity. He determined to make
   his way by the Mississippi and the Illinois to Canada, whence he might
   bring succor to the colonists, and send a report of their condition to
   France. The attempt was beset with uncertainties and dangers. The Mississippi
   was first to be found, then followed through all the perilous monotony
   of its interminable windings to a goal which was to be but the starting-point
   of a new and not less arduous journey. Cavelier his brother, Moranget
   his nephew, the friar Anastase Douay, and others to the number of twenty,
   were chosen to accompany him. Every corner of the magazine was ransacked
   for an outfit. Joutel generously gave up the better part of his wardrobe
   to La Salle and his two relatives. Duhaut, who had saved his baggage from
   the wreck of the "Aimable," was required to contribute to the necessities
   of the party; and the scantily-furnished chests of those who had died
   were used to supply the wants of the living. Each man labored with needle
   and awl to patch his failing garments, or supply their place with buffalo
   or deer skins. On the twenty-second of April, after <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg
   406]</a></span> mass and prayers in the chapel, they issued from the gate,
   each bearing his pack and his weapons, some with kettles slung at their
   backs, some with axes, some with gifts for Indians. In this guise, they
   held their way in silence across the prairie; while anxious eyes followed
   them from the palisades of St. Louis, whose inmates, not excepting Joutel
   himself, seem to have been ignorant of the extent and difficulty of the
   undertaking.<a name="fnanchor_313" id="fnanchor_313"></a><a href="#footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">WRECK OF THE "BELLE."</div>
<p>"On May Day," he writes, "at about two in the afternoon, as I was walking
   near the house, I heard a voice from the river below, crying out several
   times, <i>Qui vive?</i> Knowing that the Sieur Barbier had gone that way
   with two canoes to hunt buffalo, I thought that it might be one of these
   canoes coming back with meat, and did not think much of the matter till
   I heard the same voice again. I answered, <i>Versailles</i>, which was
   the password I had given the Sieur Barbier, in case he should come back
   in the night. But, as I was going towards the bank, I heard other voices
   which I had not heard for a long time. I recognized among the rest that
   of M. Chefdeville, which made me fear that some disaster had happened.
   I ran down to the bank, and my first greeting was to ask what had become
   of the 'Belle.' <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg
   407]</a></span> They answered that she was wrecked on the other side of
   the bay, and that all on board were drowned except the six who were in
   the canoe; namely, the Sieur Chefdeville, the Marquis de la Sablonni&egrave;re,
   the man named Teissier, a soldier, a girl, and a little boy."<a name="fnanchor_314" id="fnanchor_314"></a><a href="#footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>
<p>From the young priest Chefdeville, Joutel learned the particulars of the
   disaster. Water had failed on board the "Belle"; a boat's crew of five
   men had gone in quest of it; the wind rose, their boat was swamped, and
   they were all drowned. Those who remained had now no means of going ashore;
   but if they had no water, they had wine and brandy in abundance, and Teissier,
   the master of the vessel, was drunk every day. After a while they left
   their moorings, and tried to reach the fort; but they were few, weak,
   and unskilful. A violent north wind drove them on a sand-bar. Some of
   them were drowned in trying to reach land on a raft. Others were more
   successful; and, after a long delay, they found a stranded canoe, in which
   they made their way to St. Louis, bringing with them some of La Salle's
   papers and baggage saved from the wreck.</p>
<p>These multiplied disasters bore hard on the spirits of the colonists;
   and Joutel, like a good commander as he was, spared no pains to cheer
   them. "We did what we could to amuse ourselves and drive away care. I
   encouraged our people to dance and sing in the evenings; for when M. de
   la Salle was among <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg
   408]</a></span> us, pleasure was often banished. Now, there is no use
   in being melancholy on such occasions. It is true that M. de la Salle
   had no great cause for merry-making, after all his losses and disappointments;
   but his troubles made others suffer also. Though he had ordered me to
   allow to each person only a certain quantity of meat at every meal, I
   observed this rule only when meat was rare. The air here is very keen,
   and one has a great appetite. One must eat and act, if he wants good health
   and spirits. I speak from experience; for once, when I had ague chills,
   and was obliged to keep the house with nothing to do, I was dreary and
   down-hearted. On the contrary, if I was busy with hunting or anything
   else, I was not so dull by half. So I tried to keep the people as busy
   as possible. I set them to making a small cellar to keep meat fresh in
   hot weather; but when M. de la Salle came back, he said it was too small.
   As he always wanted to do everything on a grand scale, he prepared to
   make a large one, and marked out the plan." This plan of the large cellar,
   like more important undertakings of its unhappy projector, proved too
   extensive for execution, the colonists being engrossed by the daily care
   of keeping themselves alive.</p>
<div class="sidenote">MATRIMONY.</div>
<p>A gleam of hilarity shot for an instant out of the clouds. The young Canadian,
   Barbier, usually conducted the hunting-parties; and some of the women
   and girls often went out with them, to aid in cutting up the meat. Barbier
   became enamoured of one of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg
   409]</a></span> the girls; and as his devotion to her was the subject
   of comment, he asked Joutel for leave to marry her. The commandant, after
   due counsel with the priests and friars, vouchsafed his consent, and the
   rite was duly solemnized; whereupon, fired by the example, the Marquis
   de la Sablonni&egrave;re begged leave to marry another of the girls. Joutel,
   the gardener's son, concerned that a marquis should so abase himself,
   and anxious at the same time for the morals of the fort, which La Salle
   had especially commended to his care, not only flatly refused, but, in
   the plenitude of his authority, forbade the lovers all further intercourse.</p>
<p>Father Zenobe Membr&eacute;, superior of the mission, gave unwilling occasion
   for further merriment. These worthy friars were singularly unhappy in
   their dealings with the buffalo, one of which, it may be remembered, had
   already knocked down Father Anastase. Undeterred by his example, Father
   Zenobe one day went out with the hunters, carrying a gun like the rest.
   Joutel shot a buffalo, which was making off, badly wounded, when a second
   shot stopped it, and it presently lay down. The father superior thought
   it was dead; and, without heeding the warning shout of Joutel, he approached,
   and pushed it with the butt of his gun. The bull sprang up with an effort
   of expiring fury, and, in the words of Joutel, "trampled on the father,
   took the skin off his face in several places, and broke his gun, so that
   he could hardly manage to get away, and remained <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg
   410]</a></span> in an almost helpless state for more than three months.
   Bad as the accident was, he was laughed at nevertheless for his rashness."</p>
<p>The mishaps of the friars did not end here. Father Maxime Le Clerc was
   set upon by a boar belonging to the colony. "I do not know," says Joutel, "what
   spite the beast had against him, whether for a beating or some other offence;
   but, however this may be, I saw the father running and crying for help,
   and the boar running after him. I went to the rescue, but could not come
   up in time. The father stooped as he ran, to gather up his cassock from
   about his legs; and the boar, which ran faster than he, struck him in
   the arm with his tusks, so that some of the nerves were torn. Thus, all
   three of our good R&eacute;collet fathers were near being the victims
   of animals."<a name="fnanchor_315" id="fnanchor_315"></a><a href="#footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>
<p>In spite of his efforts to encourage them, the followers of Joutel were
   fast losing heart. Father Maxime Le Clerc kept a journal, in which he
   set down various charges against La Salle. Joutel got possession of the
   paper, and burned it on the urgent entreaty of the friars, who dreaded
   what might ensue, should the absent commander become aware of the aspersions
   cast upon him. The elder Duhaut fomented the rising discontent of the
   colonists, played the demagogue, told them that La Salle would never return,
   and tried to make himself their leader. Joutel detected the mischief,
   and, with a lenity which he afterwards deeply regretted, contented <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg
   411]</a></span> himself with a rebuke to the offender, and words of reproof
   and encouragement to the dejected band.</p>
<div class="sidenote">ADVENTURES OF THE TRAVELLERS.</div>
<p>He had caused the grass to be cut near the fort, so as to form a sort
   of playground; and here, one evening, he and some of the party were trying
   to amuse themselves, when they heard shouts from beyond the river, and
   Joutel recognized the voice of La Salle. Hastening to meet him in a wooden
   canoe, he brought him and his party to the fort. Twenty men had gone out
   with him, and eight had returned. Of the rest, four had deserted, one
   had been lost, one had been devoured by an alligator; and the others,
   giving out on the march, had probably perished in attempting to regain
   the fort. The travellers told of a rich country, a wild and beautiful
   landscape,&mdash;woods, rivers, groves, and prairies; but all availed
   nothing, and the acquisition of five horses was but an indifferent return
   for the loss of twelve men.</p>
<p>After leaving the fort, they had journeyed towards the northeast, over
   plains green as an emerald with the young verdure of April, till at length
   they saw, far as the eye could reach, the boundless prairie alive with
   herds of buffalo. The animals were in one of their tame or stupid moods;
   and they killed nine or ten of them without the least difficulty, drying
   the best parts of the meat. They crossed the Colorado on a raft, and reached
   the banks of another river, where one of the party, named Hiens, a German
   of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span> W&uuml;rtemberg,
   and an old buccaneer, was mired and nearly suffocated in a mud-hole. Unfortunately,
   as will soon appear, he managed to crawl out; and, to console him, the
   river was christened with his name. The party made a bridge of felled
   trees, on which they crossed in safety. La Salle now changed their course,
   and journeyed eastward, when the travellers soon found themselves in the
   midst of a numerous Indian population, where they were feasted and caressed
   without measure. At another village they were less fortunate. The inhabitants
   were friendly by day and hostile by night. They came to attack the French
   in their camp, but withdrew, daunted by the menacing voice of La Salle,
   who had heard them approaching through the cane-brake.</p>
<p>La Salle's favorite Shawanoe hunter, Nika, who had followed him from Canada
   to France, and from France to Texas, was bitten by a rattlesnake; and,
   though he recovered, the accident detained the party for several days.
   At length they resumed their journey, but were stopped by a river, called
   by Douay, "La Rivi&egrave;re des Malheurs." La Salle and Cavelier, with
   a few others, tried to cross on a raft, which, as it reached the channel,
   was caught by a current of marvellous swiftness. Douay and Moranget, watching
   the transit from the edge of the cane-brake, beheld their commander swept
   down the stream, and vanishing, as it were, in an instant. All that day
   they remained with their companions on the bank, lamenting in despair
   for the loss of their guardian <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg
   413]</a></span> angel, for so Douay calls La Salle.<a name="fnanchor_316" id="fnanchor_316"></a><a href="#footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> It was fast growing
   dark, when, to their unspeakable relief, they saw him advancing with his
   party along the opposite bank, having succeeded, after great exertion,
   in guiding the raft to land. How to rejoin him was now the question. Douay
   and his companions, who had tasted no food that day, broke their fast
   on two young eagles which they knocked out of their nest, and then spent
   the night in rueful consultation as to the means of crossing the river.
   In the morning they waded into the marsh, the friar with his breviary
   in his hood to keep it dry, and hacked among the canes till they had gathered
   enough to make another raft; on which, profiting by La Salle's experience,
   they safely crossed, and rejoined him.</p>
<p>Next, they became entangled in a cane-brake, where La Salle, as usual
   with him in such cases, took the lead, a hatchet in each hand, and hewed
   out a path for his followers. They soon reached the villages of the Cenis
   Indians, on and near the river Trinity,&mdash;a tribe then powerful, but
   long since extinct. Nothing could surpass the friendliness of their welcome.
   The chiefs came to meet them, bearing the calumet, and followed by warriors
   in shirts of embroidered deer-skin. Then the whole village swarmed out
   like bees, gathering around the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg
   414]</a></span> visitors with offerings of food and all that was precious
   in their eyes. La Salle was lodged with the great chief; but he compelled
   his men to encamp at a distance, lest the ardor of their gallantry might
   give occasion of offence. The lodges of the Cenis, forty or fifty feet
   high, and covered with a thatch of meadow-grass, looked like huge bee-hives.
   Each held several families, whose fire was in the middle, and their beds
   around the circumference. The spoil of the Spaniards was to be seen on
   all sides,&mdash;silver lamps and spoons, swords, old muskets, money,
   clothing, and a bull of the Pope dispensing the Spanish colonists of New
   Mexico from fasting during summer.<a name="fnanchor_317" id="fnanchor_317"></a><a href="#footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> These treasures, as well as their
   numerous horses, were obtained by the Cenis from their neighbors and allies
   the Camanches, that fierce prairie banditti who then, as now, scourged
   the Mexican border with their bloody forays. A party of these wild horsemen
   was in the village. Douay was edified at seeing them make the sign of
   the cross in imitation of the neophytes of one of the Spanish missions.
   They enacted, too, the ceremony of the mass; and one of them, in his rude
   way, drew a sketch of a picture he had seen in some church which he had
   pillaged, wherein the friar plainly recognized the Virgin weeping at the
   foot of the cross. They invited the French to join them on a raid into
   New Mexico; and they spoke with contempt, as their tribesmen will speak
   to this day, of the Spanish <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg
   415]</a></span> creoles, saying that it would be easy to conquer a nation
   of cowards who make people walk before them with fans to cool them in
   hot weather.<a name="fnanchor_318" id="fnanchor_318"></a><a href="#footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>
<p>Soon after leaving the Cenis villages, both La Salle and his nephew Moranget
   were attacked by fever. This caused a delay of more than two months, during
   which the party seem to have remained encamped on the Neches, or possibly
   the Sabine. When at length the invalids had recovered sufficient strength
   to travel, the stock of ammunition was nearly spent, some of the men had
   deserted, and the condition of the travellers was such that there seemed
   no alternative but to return to Fort St. Louis. This they accordingly
   did, greatly aided in their march by the horses bought from the Cenis,
   and suffering no very serious accident by the way,&mdash;excepting the
   loss of La Salle's servant, Dumesnil, who was seized by an alligator while
   attempting to cross the Colorado.</p>
<div class="sidenote">DEJECTION.</div>
<p>The temporary excitement caused among the colonists by their return soon
   gave place to a dejection bordering on despair. "This pleasant land," writes
   Cavelier, "seemed to us an abode of weariness and a perpetual prison." Flattering
   themselves with the delusion, common to exiles of every kind, that they
   were objects of solicitude at home, they watched daily, with straining
   eyes, for an approaching sail. Ships, indeed, had ranged the coast to
   seek them, but with no friendly intent. Their thoughts dwelt, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg
   416]</a></span> with unspeakable yearning, on the France they had left
   behind, which, to their longing fancy, was pictured as an unattainable
   Eden. Well might they despond; for of a hundred and eighty colonists,
   besides the crew of the "Belle," less than forty-five remained. The weary
   precincts of Fort St. Louis, with its fence of rigid palisades, its area
   of trampled earth, its buildings of weather-stained timber, and its well-peopled
   graveyard without, were hateful to their sight. La Salle had a heavy task
   to save them from despair. His composure, his unfailing equanimity, his
   words of encouragement and cheer, were the breath of life to this forlorn
   company; for though he could not impart to minds of less adamantine temper
   the audacity of hope with which he still clung to the final accomplishment
   of his purposes, the contagion of his hardihood touched, nevertheless,

<p>The journey to Canada was clearly their only hope; and, after a brief
   rest, La Salle prepared to renew the attempt. He proposed that Joutel
   should this time be of the party; and should proceed from Quebec to France,
   with his brother Cavelier, to solicit succors for the colony, while he
   himself <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span> returned
   to Texas. A new obstacle was presently interposed. La Salle, whose constitution
   seems to have suffered from his long course of hardships, was attacked
   in November with hernia. Joutel offered to conduct the party in his stead;
   but La Salle replied that his own presence was indispensable at the Illinois.
   He had the good fortune to recover, within four or five weeks, sufficiently
   to undertake the journey; and all in the fort busied themselves in preparing
   an outfit. In such straits were they for clothing, that the sails of the "Belle" were
   cut up to make coats for the adventurers. Christmas came, and was solemnly
   observed. There was a midnight mass in the chapel, where Membr&eacute;,
   Cavelier, Douay, and their priestly brethren stood before the altar, in
   vestments strangely contrasting with the rude temple and the ruder garb
   of the worshippers. And as Membr&eacute; elevated the consecrated wafer,
   and the lamps burned dim through the clouds of incense, the kneeling group
   drew from the daily miracle such consolation as true Catholics alone can
   know. When Twelfth Night came, all gathered in the hall, and cried, after
   the jovial old custom, "The King drinks," with hearts, perhaps, as cheerless
   as their cups, which were filled with cold water.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE LAST FAREWELL.</div>
<p>On the morrow, the band of adventurers mustered for the fatal journey.<a name="fnanchor_320" id="fnanchor_320"></a><a href="#footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
   The five horses, bought by <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg

   packed for the march; and here was gathered the wretched remnant of the
   colony,&mdash;those who were to go, and those who were to stay behind.
   These latter were about twenty in all,&mdash;Barbier, who was to command
   in the place of Joutel; Sablonni&egrave;re, who, despite his title of
   marquis, was held in great contempt;<a name="fnanchor_321" id="fnanchor_321"></a><a href="#footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> the friars, Membr&eacute; and
   Le Clerc,<a name="fnanchor_322" id="fnanchor_322"></a><a href="#footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> and the priest Chefdeville, besides a surgeon, soldiers,
   laborers, seven women and girls, and several children, doomed, in this
   deadly exile, to wait the issues of the journey, and the possible arrival
   of a tardy succor. La Salle had made them a last address, delivered, we
   are told, with that winning air which, though alien from his usual bearing,
   seems to have been at times a natural expression of this unhappy man.<a name="fnanchor_323" id="fnanchor_323"></a><a href="#footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>
   It was a bitter parting, one of sighs, tears, and embracings,&mdash;the
   farewell of those on whose souls had sunk a heavy boding that they would
   never <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span> meet
   again.<a name="fnanchor_324" id="fnanchor_324"></a><a href="#footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> Equipped and weaponed for the journey, the adventurers filed
   from the gate, crossed the river, and held their slow march over the prairies
   beyond, till intervening woods and hills shut Fort St. Louis forever from
   their sight.</p>

      and fortified with little towers at intervals, where we found the arms
      of Spain engraved on a plate of copper, with the date of 1588, attached
      to a stake. The inhabitants gave us a kind welcome, and showed us some
      hammers and an anvil, two small pieces of iron cannon, a small brass
      culverin, some pike-heads, some old sword-blades, and some books of
      Spanish comedy; and thence they guided us to a little hamlet of fishermen,
      about two leagues distant, where they showed us a second stake, also

<p class="center">ASSASSINATION OF LA SALLE.</p>
<div class="smcap" style="padding-left:1.5em; text-indent:-1.5em">His Followers.&mdash;Prairie
Travelling&mdash;A Hunters' Quarrel&mdash;The Murder of Moranget.&mdash;The Conspiracy.&mdash;Death
of La Salle: his Character.</div>
<div class="sidenote">LA SALLE'S FOLLOWERS.</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> travellers were crossing a marshy prairie towards a distant belt of
   woods that followed the course of a little river. They led with them their
   five horses, laden with their scanty baggage, and, with what was of no
   less importance, their stock of presents for Indians. Some wore the remains
   of the clothing they had worn from France, eked out with deer-skins, dressed
   in the Indian manner; and some had coats of old sail-cloth. Here was La
   Salle, in whom one would have known, at a glance, the chief of the party;
   and the priest, Cavelier, who seems to have shared not one of the high
   traits of his younger brother. Here, too, were their nephews, Moranget
   and the boy Cavelier, now about seventeen years old; the trusty soldier
   Joutel; and the friar Anastase Douay. Duhaut followed, a man of respectable
   birth and education; and Liotot, the surgeon of the party. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg
   421]</a></span> At home, they might perhaps have lived and died with a
   fair repute; but the wilderness is a rude touchstone, which often reveals
   traits that would have lain buried and unsuspected in civilized life.
   The German Hiens, the ex-buccaneer, was also of the number. He had probably
   sailed with an English crew; for he was sometimes known as <i>Gemme Anglais</i>,
   or "English Jem."<a name="fnanchor_325" id="fnanchor_325"></a><a href="#footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> The Sieur de Marie; Teissier, a pilot; L'Archev&ecirc;que,
   a servant of Duhaut; and others, to the number in all of seventeen,&mdash;made
   up the party; to which is to be added Nika, La Salle's Shawanoe hunter,
   who, as well as another Indian, had twice crossed the ocean with him,
   and still followed his fortunes with an admiring though undemonstrative
   fidelity.</p>
<p>They passed the prairie, and neared the forest. Here they saw buffalo;
   and the hunters approached, and killed several of them. Then they traversed
   the woods; found and forded the shallow and rushy stream, and pushed through
   the forest beyond, till they again reached the open prairie. Heavy clouds
   gathered over them, and it rained all night; but they sheltered themselves
   under the fresh hides of the buffalo they had killed.</p>
<div class="sidenote">PRAIRIE TRAVELLING.</div>
<p>It is impossible, as it would be needless, to follow the detail of their
   daily march.<a name="fnanchor_326" id="fnanchor_326"></a><a href="#footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> It was such an one, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg
   422]</a></span> though with unwonted hardship, as is familiar to the memory
   of many a prairie traveller of our own time. They suffered greatly from
   the want of shoes, and found for a while no better substitute than a casing
   of raw buffalo-hide, which they were forced to keep always wet, as, when
   dry, it hardened about the foot like iron. At length they bought dressed
   deer-skin from the Indians, of which they made tolerable moccasins. The
   rivers, streams, and gullies filled with water were without number; and
   to cross them they made a boat of bull-hide, like the "bull boat" still
   used on the Upper Missouri. This did good service, as, with the help of
   their horses, they could carry it with them. Two or three men could cross
   in it at once, and the horses swam after them like dogs. Sometimes they
   traversed the sunny prairie; sometimes dived into the dark recesses of
   the forest, where the buffalo, descending daily from their pastures in
   long files to drink at the river, often made a broad and easy path for
   the travellers. When foul weather arrested them, they built huts of bark
   and long meadow-grass; and safely sheltered lounged away the day, while
   their horses, picketed near by, stood steaming in the rain. At night,
   they usually set a rude stockade about their camp; and here, by <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg
   423]</a></span> the grassy border of a brook, or at the edge of a grove
   where a spring bubbled up through the sands, they lay asleep around the
   embers of their fire, while the man on guard listened to the deep breathing
   of the slumbering horses, and the howling of the wolves that saluted the
   rising moon as it flooded the waste of prairie with pale mystic radiance.</p>
<p>They met Indians almost daily,&mdash;sometimes a band of hunters, mounted
   or on foot, chasing buffalo on the plains; sometimes a party of fishermen;
   sometimes a winter camp, on the slope of a hill or under the sheltering
   border of a forest. They held intercourse with them in the distance by
   signs; often they disarmed their distrust, and attracted them into their
   camp; and often they visited them in their lodges, where, seated on buffalo-robes,
   they smoked with their entertainers, passing the pipe from hand to hand,
   after the custom still in use among the prairie tribes. Cavelier says
   that they once saw a band of a hundred and fifty mounted Indians attacking
   a herd of buffalo with lances pointed with sharpened bone. The old priest
   was delighted with the sport, which he pronounces "the most diverting
   thing in the world." On another occasion, when the party were encamped
   near the village of a tribe which Cavelier calls Sassory, he saw them
   catch an alligator about twelve feet long, which they proceeded to torture
   as if he were a human enemy,&mdash;first putting out his eyes, and then
   leading him to the neighboring prairie, where, having confined him by
   a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span> number
   of stakes, they spent the entire day in tormenting him.<a name="fnanchor_327" id="fnanchor_327"></a><a href="#footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>
<p>Holding a northerly course, the travellers crossed the Brazos, and reached
   the waters of the Trinity. The weather was unfavorable, and on one occasion
   they encamped in the rain during four or five days together. It was not
   an harmonious company. La Salle's cold and haughty reserve had returned,
   at least for those of his followers to whom he was not partial. Duhaut
   and the surgeon Liotot, both of whom were men of some property, had a
   large pecuniary stake in the enterprise, and were disappointed and incensed
   at its ruinous result. They had a quarrel with young Moranget, whose hot
   and hasty temper was as little fitted to conciliate as was the harsh reserve
   of his uncle. Already at Fort St. Louis, Duhaut had intrigued among the
   men; and the mild admonition of Joutel had not, it seems, sufficed to
   divert him from his sinister purposes. Liotot, it is said, had secretly
   sworn vengeance against La Salle, whom he charged with having caused the
   death of his brother, or, as some will have it, his nephew. On one of
   the former journeys this young man's strength had failed; and, La Salle
   having ordered him to return to the fort, he had been killed by Indians
   on the way.</p>
<div class="sidenote">MURDER OF MORANGET.</div>
<p>The party moved again as the weather improved, and on the fifteenth of
   March encamped within a few miles of a spot which La Salle had passed
   on his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span> preceding
   journey, and where he had left a quantity of Indian corn and beans in <i>cache</i>;
   that is to say, hidden in the ground or in a hollow tree. As provisions
   were falling short, he sent a party from the camp to find it. These men
   were Duhaut, Liotot,<a name="fnanchor_328" id="fnanchor_328"></a><a href="#footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> Hiens the buccaneer, Teissier, L'Archev&ecirc;que,
   Nika the hunter, and La Salle's servant Saget. They opened the <i>cache</i>,
   and found the contents spoiled; but as they returned from their bootless
   errand they saw buffalo, and Nika shot two of them. They now encamped
   on the spot, and sent the servant to inform La Salle, in order that he
   might send horses to bring in the meat. Accordingly, on the next day,
   he directed Moranget and De Marle, with the necessary horses, to go with
   Saget to the hunters' camp. When they arrived, they found that Duhaut
   and his companions had already cut up the meat, and laid it upon scaffolds
   for smoking, though it was not yet so dry as, it seems, this process required.
   Duhaut and the others had also put by, for themselves, the marrow-bones
   and certain portions of the meat, to which, by woodland custom, they had
   a perfect right. Moranget, whose rashness and violence had once before
   caused a fatal catastrophe, fell into a most unreasonable fit of rage,
   berated and menaced Duhaut and his party, and ended by seizing upon the
   whole of the meat, including the reserved portions. This added fuel to
   the fire of Duhaut's old grudge against Moranget and his uncle. There
   is reason to think <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg
   426]</a></span> that he had harbored deadly designs, the execution of
   which was only hastened by the present outbreak. The surgeon also bore
   hatred against Moranget, whom he had nursed with constant attention when
   wounded by an Indian arrow, and who had since repaid him with abuse. These
   two now took counsel apart with Hiens, Teissier, and L'Archev&ecirc;que;
   and it was resolved to kill Moranget that night. Nika, La Salle's devoted
   follower, and Saget, his faithful servant, must die with him. All of the
   five were of one mind except the pilot Teissier, who neither aided nor
   opposed the plot.</p>
<p>Night came: the woods grew dark; the evening meal was finished, and the
   evening pipes were smoked. The order of the guard was arranged; and, doubtless
   by design, the first hour of the night was assigned to Moranget, the second
   to Saget, and the third to Nika. Gun in hand, each stood watch in turn
   over the silent but not sleeping forms around him, till, his time expiring,
   he called the man who was to relieve him, wrapped himself in his blanket,
   and was soon buried in a slumber that was to be his last. Now the assassins
   rose. Duhaut and Hiens stood with their guns cocked, ready to shoot down
   any one of the destined victims who should resist or fly. The surgeon,
   with an axe, stole towards the three sleepers, and struck a rapid blow
   at each in turn. Saget and Nika died with little movement; but Moranget
   started spasmodically into a sitting posture, gasping and unable to speak;
   and the murderers <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg
   427]</a></span> compelled De Marle, who was not in their plot, to compromise
   himself by despatching him.</p>
<p>The floodgates of murder were open, and the torrent must have its way.
   Vengeance and safety alike demanded the death of La Salle. Hiens, or "English
   Jem," alone seems to have hesitated; for he was one of those to whom that
   stern commander had always been partial. Meanwhile, the intended victim
   was still at his camp, about six miles distant. It is easy to picture,
   with sufficient accuracy, the features of the scene,&mdash;the sheds of
   bark and branches, beneath which, among blankets and buffalo-robes, camp-utensils,
   pack-saddles, rude harness, guns, powder-horns, and bullet-pouches, the
   men lounged away the hour, sleeping or smoking, or talking among themselves;
   the blackened kettles that hung from tripods of poles over the fires;
   the Indians strolling about the place or lying, like dogs in the sun,
   with eyes half-shut, yet all observant; and, in the neighboring meadow,
   the horses grazing under the eye of a watchman.</p>
<div class="sidenote">SUSPENSE.</div>
<p>It was the eighteenth of March. Moranget and his companions had been expected
   to return the night before; but the whole day passed, and they did not
   appear. La Salle became very anxious. He resolved to go and look for them;
   but not well knowing the way, he told the Indians who were about the camp
   that he would give them a hatchet if they would guide him. One of them
   accepted the offer; and La Salle prepared to set out in the morning, at <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg
   428]</a></span> the same time directing Joutel to be ready to go with
   him. Joutel says: "That evening, while we were talking about what could
   have happened to the absent men, he seemed to have a presentiment of what
   was to take place. He asked me if I had heard of any machinations against
   them, or if I had noticed any bad design on the part of Duhaut and the
   rest. I answered that I had heard nothing, except that they sometimes
   complained of being found fault with so often; and that this was all I
   knew; besides which, as they were persuaded that I was in his interest,
   they would not have told me of any bad design they might have. We were
   very uneasy all the rest of the evening."</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE FATAL SHOT.</div>
<p>In the morning, La Salle set out with his Indian guide. He had changed
   his mind with regard to Joutel, whom he now directed to remain in charge
   of the camp and to keep a careful watch. He told the friar Anastase Douay
   to come with him instead of Joutel, whose gun, which was the best in the
   party, he borrowed for the occasion, as well as his pistol. The three
   proceeded on their way,&mdash;La Salle, the friar, and the Indian. "All
   the way," writes the friar, "he spoke to me of nothing but matters of
   piety, grace, and predestination; enlarging on the debt he owed to God,
   who had saved him from so many perils during more than twenty years of
   travel in America. Suddenly, I saw him overwhelmed with a profound sadness,
   for which he himself could not account. He was so much moved <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg
   429]</a></span> that I scarcely knew him." He soon recovered his usual
   calmness; and they walked on till they approached the camp of Duhaut,
   which was on the farther side of a small river. Looking about him with
   the eye of a woodsman, La Salle saw two eagles circling in the air nearly
   over him, as if attracted by carcasses of beasts or men. He fired his
   gun and his pistol, as a summons to any of his followers who might be
   within hearing. The shots reached the ears of the conspirators. Rightly
   conjecturing by whom they were fired, several of them, led by Duhaut,
   crossed the river at a little distance above, where trees or other intervening
   objects hid them from sight. Duhaut and the surgeon crouched like Indians
   in the long, dry, reed-like grass of the last summer's growth, while L'Archev&ecirc;que
   stood in sight near the bank. La Salle, continuing to advance, soon saw
   him, and, calling to him, demanded where was Moranget. The man, without
   lifting his hat, or any show of respect, replied in an agitated and broken
   voice, but with a tone of studied insolence, that Moranget was strolling
   about somewhere. La Salle rebuked and menaced him. He rejoined with increased
   insolence, drawing back, as he spoke, towards the ambuscade, while the
   incensed commander advanced to chastise him. At that moment a shot was
   fired from the grass, instantly followed by another; and, pierced through
   the brain, La Salle dropped dead.</p>
<p>The friar at his side stood terror-stricken, unable <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg
         430]</a></span> to advance or to fly; when Duhaut, rising from the
         ambuscade, called out to him to take courage, for he had nothing
         to fear. The murderers now came forward, and with wild looks gathered
         about their victim. "There thou liest, great Bashaw! There thou
         liest!"<a name="fnanchor_329" id="fnanchor_329"></a><a href="#footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> exclaimed the surgeon Liotot, in base exultation over
         the unconscious corpse. With mockery and insult, they stripped it
         naked, dragged it into the bushes, and left it there, a prey to
         the buzzards and the wolves.</p>
<p>Thus in the vigor of his manhood, at the age of forty-three, died Robert
   Cavelier de la Salle, "one of the greatest men," writes Tonty, "of this
   age;" without question one of the most remarkable explorers whose names
   live in history. His faithful officer Joutel thus sketches his portrait: "His
   firmness, his courage, his great knowledge of the arts and sciences, which
   made him equal to every undertaking, and his untiring energy, which enabled
   him to surmount every obstacle, would have won at last a glorious success
   for his grand enterprise, had not all his fine qualities been counterbalanced
   by a haughtiness of manner which often made him insupportable, and by
   a harshness towards those under his command which drew upon him an implacable
   hatred, and was at last the cause of his death."<a name="fnanchor_330" id="fnanchor_330"></a><a href="#footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">HIS CHARACTER.</div>
<p>The enthusiasm of the disinterested and chivalrous <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg
         431]</a></span> Champlain was not the enthusiasm of La Salle; nor
         had he any part in the self-devoted zeal of the early Jesuit explorers.
         He belonged not to the age of the knight-errant and the saint, but
         to the modern world of practical study and practical action. He
         was the hero not of a principle nor of a faith, but simply of a
         fixed idea and a determined purpose. As often happens with concentred
         and energetic natures, his purpose was to him a passion and an inspiration;
         and he clung to it with a certain fanaticism of devotion. It was
         the offspring of an ambition vast and comprehensive, yet acting
         in the interest both of France and of civilization.</p>
<p>Serious in all things, incapable of the lighter pleasures, incapable of
   repose, finding no joy but in the pursuit of great designs, too shy for
   society and too reserved for popularity, often unsympathetic and always
   seeming so, smothering emotions which he could not utter, schooled to
   universal distrust, stern to his followers and pitiless to himself, bearing
   the brunt of every hardship and every danger, demanding of others an equal
   constancy joined to an implicit deference, heeding no counsel but his
   own, attempting the impossible and grasping at what was too vast to hold,&mdash;he
   contained in his own complex and painful nature the chief springs of his
   triumphs, his failures, and his death.</p>
<p>It is easy to reckon up his defects, but it is not easy to hide from sight
   the Roman virtues that redeemed them. Beset by a throng of enemies, he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg
   432]</a></span> stands, like the King of Israel, head and shoulders above
   them all. He was a tower of adamant, against whose impregnable front hardship
   and danger, the rage of man and of the elements, the southern sun, the
   northern blast, fatigue, famine, disease, delay, disappointment, and deferred
   hope emptied their quivers in vain. That very pride which, Coriolanus-like,
   declared itself most sternly in the thickest press of foes, has in it
   something to challenge admiration. Never, under the impenetrable mail
   of paladin or crusader, beat a heart of more intrepid mettle than within
   the stoic panoply that armed the breast of La Salle. To estimate aright
   the marvels of his patient fortitude, one must follow on his track through
   the vast scene of his interminable journeyings,&mdash;those thousands
   of weary miles of forest, marsh, and river, where, again and again, in
   the bitterness of baffled striving, the untiring pilgrim pushed onward
   towards the goal which he was never to attain. America owes him an enduring
   memory; for in this masculine figure she sees the pioneer who guided her
   to the possession of her richest heritage.<a name="fnanchor_331" id="fnanchor_331"></a><a href="#footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

      of his statements are irreconcilable with those of Joutel and Douay;
      and known facts of his history justify the suspicion of a wilful inaccuracy.
      Joutel's account is of a very different character, and seems to be
      the work of an honest and intelligent man. Douay's account if brief;

      The narrative of Douay, who was with him at the time. 2. That of Joutel,
      who learned the facts, immediately after they took place, from Douay
      and others, and who parted from La Salle an hour or more before his
      death. 3. A document preserved in the Archives de la Marine, entitled <i>Relation
      de la Mort du Sr. de la Salle, suivant le rapport d'un nomm&eacute; Couture &agrave; qui
      M. Cavelier l'apprit en passant au pays des Akansa, avec toutes les
      circonstances que le dit Couture a apprises d'un Fran&ccedil;ois que
      M. Cavelier avoit laiss&eacute; aux dits pays des Akansa, crainte qu'il
      ne gard&acirc;t pas le secret</i>. 4. The authentic  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg
   433]</a></span>memoir of Tonty,
      of which a copy from the original is before me, and which has recently
      been printed by Margry.</p>
   <p>The narrative of Cavelier unfortunately fails us several weeks before
      the death of his brother, the remainder being lost. On a study of these
      various documents, it is impossible to resist the conclusion that neither
      Cavelier nor Douay always wrote honestly. Joutel, on the contrary,
      gives the impression of sense, intelligence, and candor throughout.
      Charlevoix, who knew him long after, says that he was "un fort honn&ecirc;te
      homme, et le seul de la troupe de M. de la Salle, sur qui ce c&eacute;l&egrave;bre
      voyageur p&ucirc;t compter." Tonty derived his information from the
      survivors of La Salle's party. Couture, whose statements are embodied
      in the <i>Relation de la Mort de M. de la Salle</i>, was one of Tonty's
      men, who, as will be seen hereafter, were left by him at the mouth
      of the Arkansas, and to whom Cavelier told the story of his brother's
      death. Couture also repeats the statements of one of La Salle's followers,
      undoubtedly a Parisian boy, named Barthelemy, who was violently prejudiced
      against his chief, whom he slanders to the utmost of his skill, saying
      that he was so enraged at his failures that he did not approach the
      sacraments for two years; that he nearly starved his brother Cavelier,
      allowing him only a handful of meal a day; that he killed with his
      own hand "quantit&eacute; de personnes," who did not work to his liking;
      and that he killed the sick in their beds, without mercy, under the
      pretence that they were counterfeiting sickness in order to escape
      work. These assertions certainly have no other foundation than the
      undeniable rigor of La Salle's command. Douay says that he confessed
      and made his devotions on the morning of his death, while Cavelier
      always speaks of him as the hope and the staff of the colony.</p>
   <p>Douay declares that La Salle lived an hour after the fatal shot; that
      he gave him absolution, buried his body, and planted a cross on his
      grave. At the time, he told Joutel a different story; and the latter,
      with the best means of learning the facts, explicitly denies the friar's
      printed statement. Couture, on the authority of Cavelier himself, also
      says that neither he nor Douay was permitted to take any step for burying
      the body. Tonty says that Cavelier begged leave to do so, but was refused.
      Douay, unwilling to place upon record facts from which the inference
      might easily be drawn that he had been terrified from discharging his
      duty, no doubt invented the story of the burial, as well as that of
      the edifying behavior of Moranget, after he had been struck in the
      head with an axe.</p>
   <p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg
      434]</a></span></p>
   <p>The locality of La Salle's assassination is sufficiently clear, from
      a comparison of the several narratives; and it is also indicated on
      a contemporary manuscript map, made on the return of the survivors
      of the party to France. The scene of the catastrophe is here placed
      on a southern branch of the Trinity.</p>
   <p>La Salle's debts, at the time of his death, according to a schedule
      presented in 1701 to Champigny, intendant of Canada, amounted to 106,831
      livres, without reckoning interest. This cannot be meant to include
      all, as items are given which raise the amount much higher. In 1678
      and 1679 alone, he contracted debts to the amount of 97,184 livres,
      of which 46,000 were furnished by Branssac, fiscal attorney of the
      Seminary of Montreal. This was to be paid in beaver-skins. Frontenac,
      at the same time, became his surety for 13,623 livres. In 1684, he
      borrowed 34,825 livres from the Sieur Pen, at Paris. These sums do
      not include the losses incurred by his family, which, in the memorial
      presented by them to the King, are set down at 500,000 livres for the
      expeditions between 1678 and 1683, and 300,000 livres for the fatal
      Texan expedition of 1684 These last figures are certainly exaggerated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father Anastase Douay</span> returned to the camp, and, aghast with grief and
   terror, rushed into the hut of Cavelier. "My poor brother is dead!" cried
   the priest, instantly divining the catastrophe from the horror-stricken
   face of the messenger. Close behind came the murderers, Duhaut at their
   head. Cavelier, his young nephew, and Douay himself, all fell on their
   knees, expecting instant death. The priest begged piteously for half an
   hour to prepare for his end; but terror and submission sufficed, and no
   more blood was shed. The camp yielded without resistance; and Duhaut was
   lord of all. In truth, there were none to oppose him; for, except the
   assassins themselves, the party was now reduced to six <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg
   436]</a></span> persons,&mdash;Joutel, Douay, the elder Cavelier, his
   young nephew, and two other boys, the orphan Talon and a lad called Barthelemy.</p>
<div class="sidenote">DOUBT AND ANXIETY.</div>
<p>Joutel, for the moment, was absent; and L'Archev&ecirc;que, who had a
   kindness for him, went quietly to seek him. He found him on a hillock,
   making a fire of dried grass in order that the smoke might guide La Salle
   on his return, and watching the horses grazing in the meadow below. "I
   was very much surprised," writes Joutel, "when I saw him approaching.
   When he came up to me he seemed all in confusion, or, rather, out of his
   wits. He began with saying that there was very bad news. I asked what
   it was. He answered that the Sieur de la Salle was dead, and also his
   nephew the Sieur de Moranget, his Indian hunter, and his servant. I was
   petrified, and did not know what to say; for I saw that they had been
   murdered. The man added that, at first, the murderers had sworn to kill
   me too. I easily believed it, for I had always been in the interest of
   M. de la Salle, and had commanded in his place; and it is hard to please
   everybody, or prevent some from being dissatisfied. I was greatly perplexed
   as to what I ought to do, and whether I had not better escape to the woods,
   whithersoever God should guide me; but, by bad or good luck, I had no
   gun and only one pistol, without balls or powder except what was in my
   powder-horn. To whatever side I turned, my life was in great peril. It
   is true that L'Archev&ecirc;que assured me that they <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg
   437]</a></span> had changed their minds, and had agreed to murder nobody
   else, unless they met with resistance. So, being in no condition, as I
   just said, to go far, having neither arms nor powder, I abandoned myself
   to Providence, and went back to the camp, where I found that these wretched
   murderers had seized everything belonging to M. de la Salle, and even
   my personal effects. They had also taken possession of all the arms. The
   first words that Duhaut said to me were, that each should command in turn;
   to which I made no answer. I saw M. Cavelier praying in a corner, and
   Father Anastase in another. He did not dare to speak to me, nor did I
   dare to go towards him till I had seen the designs of the assassins. They
   were in furious excitement, but, nevertheless, very uneasy and embarrassed.
   I was some time without speaking, and, as it were, without moving, for
   fear of giving umbrage to our enemies.</p>
<p>"They had cooked some meat, and when it was supper-time they distributed
   it as they saw fit, saying that formerly their share had been served out
   to them, but that it was they who would serve it out in future. They,
   no doubt, wanted me to say something that would give them a chance to
   make a noise; but I managed always to keep my mouth closed. When night
   came and it was time to stand guard, they were in perplexity, as they
   could not do it alone; therefore they said to M. Cavelier, Father Anastase,
   me, and the others who were not in the plot with them, that all we had
   to do was to stand <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg
   438]</a></span> guard as usual; that there was no use in thinking about
   what had happened,&mdash;that what was done was done; that they had been
   driven to it by despair, and that they were sorry for it, and meant no
   more harm to anybody. M. Cavelier took up the word, and told them that
   when they killed M. de la Salle they killed themselves, for there was
   nobody but him who could get us out of this country. At last, after a
   good deal of talk on both sides, they gave us our arms. So we stood guard;
   during which, M. Cavelier told me how they had come to the camp, entered
   his hut like so many madmen, and seized everything in it."</p>
<p>Joutel, Douay, and the two Caveliers spent a sleepless night, consulting
   as to what they should do. They mutually pledged themselves to stand by
   each other to the last, and to escape as soon as they could from the company
   of the assassins. In the morning, Duhaut and his accomplices, after much
   discussion, resolved to go to the Cenis villages; and, accordingly, the
   whole party broke up their camp, packed their horses, and began their
   march. They went five leagues, and encamped at the edge of a grove. On
   the following day they advanced again till noon, when heavy rains began,
   and they were forced to stop by the banks of a river. "We passed the night
   and the next day there," says Joutel; "and during that time my mind was
   possessed with dark thoughts. It was hard to prevent ourselves from being
   in constant fear among such men, and we could not look at <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg
   439]</a></span> them without horror. When I thought of the cruel deeds
   they had committed, and the danger we were in from them, I longed to revenge
   the evil they had done us. This would have been easy while they were asleep;
   but M. Cavelier dissuaded us, saying that we ought to leave vengeance
   to God, and that he himself had more to revenge than we, having lost his
   brother and his nephew."</p>
<div class="sidenote">JOURNEY TO THE CENIS.</div>
<p>The comic alternated with the tragic. On the twenty-third, they reached
   the bank of a river too deep to ford. Those who knew how to swim crossed
   without difficulty, but Joutel, Cavelier, and Douay were not of the number.
   Accordingly, they launched a log of light, dry wood, embraced it with
   one arm, and struck out for the other bank with their legs and the arm
   that was left free. But the friar became frightened. "He only clung fast
   to the aforesaid log," says Joutel, "and did nothing to help us forward.
   While I was trying to swim, my body being stretched at full length, I
   hit him in the belly with my feet; on which he thought it was all over
   with him, and, I can answer for it, he invoked Saint Francis with might
   and main. I could not help laughing, though I was myself in danger of
   drowning." Some Indians who had joined the party swam to the rescue, and
   pushed the log across.</p>
<p>The path to the Cenis villages was exceedingly faint, and but for the
   Indians they would have lost the way. They crossed the main stream of
   the Trinity in a boat of raw hides, and then, being short <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg
   440]</a></span> of provisions, held a council to determine what they should
   do. It was resolved that Joutel, with Hiens, Liotot, and Teissier, should
   go in advance to the villages and buy a supply of corn. Thus, Joutel found
   himself doomed to the company of three villains, who, he strongly suspected,
   were contriving an opportunity to kill him; but, as he had no choice,
   he dissembled his doubts, and set out with his sinister companions, Duhaut
   having first supplied him with goods for the intended barter.</p>
<div class="sidenote">JOUTEL AND THE CENIS.</div>
<p>They rode over hills and plains till night, encamped, supped on a wild
   turkey, and continued their journey till the afternoon of the next day,
   when they saw three men approaching on horseback, one of whom, to Joutel's
   alarm, was dressed like a Spaniard. He proved, however, to be a Cenis
   Indian, like the others. The three turned their horses' heads, and accompanied
   the Frenchmen on their way. At length they neared the Indian town, which,
   with its large thatched lodges, looked like a cluster of gigantic haystacks.
   Their approach had been made known, and they were received in solemn state.
   Twelve of the elders came to meet them in their dress of ceremony, each
   with his face daubed red or black, and his head adorned with painted plumes.
   From their shoulders hung deer-skins wrought with gay colors. Some carried
   war-clubs; some, bows and arrows; some, the blades of Spanish rapiers,
   attached to wooden handles decorated with hawk's bells and bunches of
   feathers. They stopped <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg
   441]</a></span> before the honored guests, and, raising their hands aloft,
   uttered howls so extraordinary that Joutel could hardly preserve the gravity
   which the occasion demanded. Having next embraced the Frenchmen, the elders
   conducted them into the village, attended by a crowd of warriors and young
   men; ushered them into their town-hall, a large lodge, devoted to councils,
   feasts, dances, and other public assemblies; seated them on mats, and
   squatted in a ring around them. Here they were regaled with sagamite or
   Indian porridge, corn-cake, beans, bread made of the meal of parched corn,
   and another kind of bread made of the kernels of nuts and the seed of
   sunflowers. Then the pipe was lighted, and all smoked together. The four
   Frenchmen proposed to open a traffic for provisions, and their entertainers
   grunted assent.</p>
<p>Joutel found a Frenchman in the village. He was a young man from Provence,
   who had deserted from La Salle on his last journey, and was now, to all
   appearance, a savage like his adopted countrymen, being naked like them,
   and affecting to have forgotten his native language. He was very friendly,
   however, and invited the visitors to a neighboring village, where he lived,
   and where, as he told them, they would find a better supply of corn. They
   accordingly set out with him, escorted by a crowd of Indians. They saw
   lodges and clusters of lodges scattered along their path at intervals,
   each with its field of corn, beans, and pumpkins, rudely cultivated <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg
   442]</a></span> with a wooden hoe. Reaching their destination, which was
   four or five leagues distant, they were greeted with the same honors as
   at the first village, and, the ceremonial of welcome over, were lodged
   in the abode of the savage Frenchman. It is not to be supposed, however,
   that he and his squaws, of whom he had a considerable number, dwelt here
   alone; for these lodges of the Cenis often contained eight or ten families.
   They were made by firmly planting in a circle tall, straight young trees,
   such as grew in the swamps. The tops were then bent inward and lashed
   together; great numbers of cross-pieces were bound on; and the frame thus
   constructed was thickly covered with thatch, a hole being left at the
   top for the escape of the smoke. The inmates were ranged around the circumference
   of the structure, each family in a kind of stall, open in front, but separated
   from those adjoining it by partitions of mats. Here they placed their
   beds of cane, their painted robes of buffalo and deer-skin, their cooking
   utensils of pottery, and other household goods; and here, too, the head
   of the family hung his bow, quiver, lance, and shield. There was nothing
   in common but the fire, which burned in the middle of the lodge, and was
   never suffered to go out. These dwellings were of great size, and Joutel
   declares that he has seen some of them sixty feet in diameter.<a name="fnanchor_332" id="fnanchor_332"></a><a href="#footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg
   443]</a></span></p>
<p>It was in one of the largest that the four travellers were now lodged.
   A place was assigned them where to bestow their baggage; and they took
   possession of their quarters amid the silent stares of the whole community.
   They asked their renegade countryman, the Proven&ccedil;al, if they were
   safe. He replied that they were; but this did not wholly reassure them,
   and they spent a somewhat wakeful night. In the morning, they opened their
   budgets, and began a brisk trade in knives, awls, beads, and other trinkets,
   which they exchanged for corn and beans. Before evening, they had acquired
   a considerable stock; and Joutel's three companions declared their intention
   of returning with it to the camp, leaving him to continue the trade. They
   went, accordingly, in the morning; and Joutel was left alone. On the one
   hand, he was glad to be rid of them; on the other, he found his position
   among the Cenis very irksome, and, as he thought, insecure. Besides the
   Proven&ccedil;al, who had gone with Liotot and his companions, there were
   two other French deserters among this tribe, and Joutel was very desirous
   to see them, hoping that they could tell him the way to the Mississippi; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg
   444]</a></span> for he was resolved to escape, at the first opportunity,
   from the company of Duhaut and his accomplices. He therefore made the
   present of a knife to a young Indian, whom he sent to find the two Frenchmen
   and invite them to come to the village. Meanwhile he continued his barter,
   but under many difficulties; for he could only explain himself by signs,
   and his customers, though friendly by day, pilfered his goods by night.
   This, joined to the fears and troubles which burdened his mind, almost
   deprived him of sleep, and, as he confesses, greatly depressed his spirits.
   Indeed, he had little cause for cheerfulness as to the past, present,
   or future. An old Indian, one of the patriarchs of the tribe, observing
   his dejection and anxious to relieve it, one evening brought him a young
   wife, saying that he made him a present of her. She seated herself at
   his side; "but," says Joutel, "as my head was full of other cares and
   anxieties, I said nothing to the poor girl. She waited for a little time;
   and then, finding that I did not speak a word, she went away."<a name="fnanchor_333" id="fnanchor_333"></a><a href="#footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">WHITE SAVAGES.</div>
<p>Late one night, he lay between sleeping and waking on the buffalo-robe
   that covered his bed of canes. All around the great lodge, its inmates
   were buried in sleep; and the fire  treasured
   scalp-locks, the spear and war-club, and shield of whitened bull-hide&mdash;that
   hung by each warrior's resting-place. Such was the weird <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg
   445]</a></span> scene that lingered on the dreamy eyes of Joutel, as he
   closed them at last in a troubled sleep. The sound of a footstep soon
   wakened him; and, turning, he saw at his side the figure of a naked savage,
   armed with a bow and arrows. Joutel spoke, but received no answer. Not
   knowing what to think, he reached out his hand for his pistols; on which
   the intruder withdrew, and seated himself by the fire. Thither Joutel
   followed; and as the light fell on his features, he looked at him closely.
   His face was tattooed, after the Cenis fashion, in lines drawn from the
   top of the forehead and converging to the chin; and his body was decorated
   with similar embellishments. Suddenly, this supposed Indian rose and threw
   his arms around Joutel's neck, making himself known, at the same time,
   as one of the Frenchmen who had deserted from La Salle and taken refuge
   among the Cenis. He was a Breton sailor named Ruter. His companion, named
   Grollet, also a sailor, had been afraid to come to the village lest he
   should meet La Salle. Ruter expressed surprise and regret when he heard
   of the death of his late commander. He had deserted him but a few months
   before. That brief interval had sufficed to transform him into a savage;
   and both he and his companion found their present reckless and ungoverned
   way of life greatly to their liking. He could tell nothing of the Mississippi;
   and on the next day he went home, carrying with him a present of beads
   for his wives, of which last he had made a large collection.</p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg
   446]</a></span></p>
<p>In a few days he reappeared, bringing Grollet with him. Each wore a bunch
   of turkey-feathers dangling from his head, and each had wrapped his naked
   body in a blanket. Three men soon after arrived from Duhaut's camp, commissioned
   to receive the corn which Joutel had purchased. They told him that Duhaut
   and Liotot, the tyrants of the party, had resolved to return to Fort St.
   Louis, and build a vessel to escape to the West Indies,&mdash;"a visionary
   scheme," writes Joutel, "for our carpenters were all dead; and even if
   they had been alive, they were so ignorant that they would not have known
   how to go about the work; besides, we had no tools for it. Nevertheless,
   I was obliged to obey, and set out for the camp with the provisions."</p>
<p>On arriving, he found a wretched state of affairs. Douay and the two Caveliers,
   who had been treated by Duhaut with great harshness and contempt, had
   been told to make their mess apart; and Joutel now joined them. This separation
   restored them their freedom of speech, of which they had hitherto been
   deprived; but it subjected them to incessant hunger, as they were allowed
   only food enough to keep them from famishing. Douay says that quarrels
   were rife among the assassins themselves,&mdash;the malcontents being
   headed by Hiens, who was enraged that Duhaut and Liotot should have engrossed
   all the plunder. Joutel was helpless, for he had none to back him but
   two priests and a boy.</p>
<div class="sidenote">SCHEMES OF ESCAPE.</div>
<p>He and his companions talked of nothing around <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg
         447]</a></span> their solitary camp-fire but the means of escaping
         from the villanous company into which they were thrown. They saw
         no resource but to find the Mississippi, and thus make their way
         to Canada,&mdash;a prodigious undertaking in their forlorn condition;
         nor was there any probability that the assassins would permit them
         to go. These, on their part, were beset with difficulties. They
         could not return to civilization without manifest peril of a halter;
         and their only safety was to turn buccaneers or savages. Duhaut,
         however, still held to his plan of going back to Fort St. Louis;
         and Joutel and his companions, who with good reason stood in daily
         fear of him, devised among themselves a simple artifice to escape
         from his company. The elder Cavelier was to tell him that they were
         too fatigued for the journey, and wished to stay among the Cenis;
         and to beg him to allow them a portion of the goods, for which Cavelier
         was to give his note of hand. The old priest, whom a sacrifice of
         truth even on less important occasions cost no great effort, accordingly
         opened the negotiation, and to his own astonishment and that of
         his companions, gained the assent of Duhaut. Their joy, however,
         was short; for Ruter, the French savage, to whom Joutel had betrayed
         his intention, when inquiring the way to the Mississippi, told it
         to Duhaut, who on this changed front and made the ominous declaration
         that he and his men would also go to Canada. Joutel and his companions
         were now filled with alarm; for there was no likelihood that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg
         448]</a></span> the assassins would permit them, the witnesses of
         their crime, to reach the settlements alive. In the midst of their
         trouble, the sky was cleared as by the crash of a thunderbolt.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE CRISIS.</div>
<p>Hiens and several others had gone, some time before, to the Cenis villages
   to purchase horses; and here they had been detained by the charms of the
   Indian women. During their stay, Hiens heard of Duhaut's new plan of going
   to Canada by the Mississippi; and he declared to those with him that he
   would not consent. On a morning early in May he appeared at Duhaut's camp,
   with Ruter and Grollet, the French savages, and about twenty Indians.
   Duhaut and Liotot, it is said, were passing the time by practising with
   bows and arrows in front of their hut. One of them called to Hiens, "Good-morning;" but
   the buccaneer returned a sullen answer. He then accosted Duhaut, telling
   him that he had no mind to go up the Mississippi with him, and demanding
   a share of the goods. Duhaut replied that the goods were his own, since
   La Salle had owed him money. "So you will not give them to me?" returned
   Hiens. "No," was the answer. "You are a wretch!" exclaimed Hiens; "you
   killed my master."<a name="fnanchor_334" id="fnanchor_334"></a><a href="#footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> And drawing a pistol from his belt he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg
   449]</a></span> fired at Duhaut, who staggered three or four paces and
   fell dead. Almost at the same instant Ruter fired his gun at Liotot, shot
   three balls into his body, and stretched him on the ground mortally wounded.</p>
<p>Douay and the two Caveliers stood in extreme terror, thinking that their
   turn was to come next. Joutel, no less alarmed, snatched his gun to defend
   himself; but Hiens called to him to fear nothing, declaring that what
   he had done was only to avenge the death of La Salle,&mdash;to which,
   nevertheless, he had been privy, though not an active sharer in the crime.
   Liotot lived long enough to make his confession, after which Ruter killed
   him by exploding a pistol loaded with a blank charge of powder against
   his head. Duhaut's myrmidon, L'Archev&ecirc;que, was absent, hunting,
   and Hiens was for killing him on his return; but the two priests and Joutel
   succeeded in dissuading him.</p>
<p>The Indian spectators beheld these murders with undisguised amazement,
   and almost with horror. What manner of men were these who had pierced
   the secret places of the wilderness to riot in mutual slaughter? Their
   fiercest warriors might learn a lesson in ferocity from these heralds
   of civilization. Joutel and his companions, who could not dispense with
   the aid of the Cenis, were obliged to explain away, as they best might,
   the atrocity of what they had witnessed.<a name="fnanchor_335" id="fnanchor_335"></a><a href="#footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>
<p>Hiens, and others of the French, had before <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg
         450]</a></span> promised to join the Cenis on an expedition against
         a neighboring tribe with whom they were at war; and the whole party
         having removed to the Indian village, the warriors and their allies
         prepared to depart. Six Frenchmen went with Hiens; and the rest,
         including Joutel, Douay, and the Caveliers, remained behind, in
         the lodge where Joutel had been domesticated, and where none were
         now left but women, children, and old men. Here they remained a
         week or more, watched closely by the Cenis, who would not let them
         leave the village; when news at length arrived of a great victory,
         and the warriors soon after returned with forty-eight scalps. It
         was the French guns that won the battle, but not the less did they
         glory in their prowess; and several days were spent in ceremonies
         and feasts of triumph.<a name="fnanchor_336" id="fnanchor_336"></a><a href="#footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>
<p>When all this hubbub of rejoicing had subsided, Joutel and his companions
   broke to Hiens their plan of attempting to reach home by way of the Mississippi.
   As they had expected, he opposed it vehemently, declaring that for his
   own part he would not run such a risk of losing his head; but at length
   he consented to their departure, on condition that the elder Cavelier
   should give him a certificate of his entire innocence of the murder of
   La Salle, which the priest did not hesitate to do. For the rest, Hiens
   treated his departing fellow-travellers with the generosity of a successful
   free-booter; for he gave them a good <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg
   451]</a></span> share of the plunder he had won by his late crime, supplying
   them with hatchets, knives, beads, and other articles of trade, besides
   several horses. Meanwhile, adds Joutel, "we had the mortification and
   chagrin of seeing this scoundrel walking about the camp in a scarlet coat
   laced with gold which had belonged to the late Monsieur de la Salle, and
   which he had seized upon, as also upon all the rest of his property." A
   well-aimed shot would have avenged the wrong, but Joutel was clearly a
   mild and moderate person; and the elder Cavelier had constantly opposed
   all plans of violence. Therefore they stifled their emotions, and armed
   themselves with patience.</p>
<div class="sidenote">JOUTEL AND HIS PARTY.</div>
<p>Joutel's party consisted, besides himself, of the Caveliers (uncle and
   nephew), Anastase Douay, De Marle, Teissier, and a young Parisian named
   Barthelemy. Teissier, an accomplice in the murders of Moranget and La
   Salle, had obtained a pardon, in form, from the elder Cavelier. They had
   six horses and three Cenis guides. Hiens embraced them at parting, as
   did the ruffians who remained with him. Their course was northeast, toward
   the mouth of the Arkansas,&mdash;a distant goal, the way to which was
   beset with so many dangers that their chance of reaching it seemed small.
   It was early in June, and the forests and prairies were green with the
   verdure of opening summer.</p>
<p>They soon reached the Assonis, a tribe near the Sabine, who received them
   well, and gave them guides to the nations dwelling towards Red River. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg
   452]</a></span> On the twenty-third, they approached a village, the inhabitants
   of which, regarding them as curiosities of the first order, came out in
   a body to see them; and, eager to do them honor, they required them to
   mount on their backs, and thus make their entrance in procession. Joutel,
   being large and heavy, weighed down his bearer, insomuch that two of his
   countrymen were forced to sustain him, one on each side. On arriving,
   an old chief washed their faces with warm water from an earthen pan, and
   then invited them to mount on a scaffold of canes, where they sat in the
   hot sun listening to four successive speeches of welcome, of which they
   understood not a word.<a name="fnanchor_337" id="fnanchor_337"></a><a href="#footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>
<p>At the village of another tribe, farther on their way, they met with a
   welcome still more oppressive. Cavelier, the unworthy successor of his
   brother, being represented as the chief of the party, became the principal
   victim of their attentions. They danced the calumet before him; while
   an Indian, taking him, with an air of great respect, by the shoulders
   as he sat, shook him in cadence with the thumping of the drum. They then
   placed two girls close beside him, as his wives; while, at the same time,
   an old chief tied a painted feather in his hair. These proceedings so
   scandalized him that, pretending <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg
   453]</a></span> to be ill, he broke off the ceremony; but they continued
   to sing all night, with so much zeal that several of them were reduced
   to a state of complete exhaustion.</p>
<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL AT THE ARKANSAS.</div>
<p>At length, after a journey of about two months, during which they lost
   one of their number,&mdash;De Marle, accidentally drowned while bathing,&mdash;the
   travellers approached the river Arkansas, at a point not far above its
   junction with the Mississippi. Led by their Indian guides, they traversed
   a rich district of plains and woods, and stood at length on the borders
   of the stream. Nestled beneath the forests of the farther shore, they
   saw the lodges of a large Indian town; and here, as they gazed across
   the broad current, they presently descried an object which nerved their
   spent limbs, and thrilled their homesick hearts with joy. It was a tall,
   wooden cross; and near it was a small house, built evidently by Christian
   hands. With one accord they fell on their knees, and raised their hands
   to Heaven in thanksgiving. Two men, in European dress, issued from the
   door of the house and fired their guns to salute the excited travellers,
   who on their part replied with a volley. Canoes put out from the farther
   shore and ferried them to the town, where they were welcomed by Couture
   and De Launay, two followers of Henri de Tonty.<a name="fnanchor_338" id="fnanchor_338"></a><a href="#footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>
<p>That brave, loyal, and generous man, always vigilant and always active,
   beloved and feared alike by <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg
   454]</a></span> white men and by red,<a name="fnanchor_339" id="fnanchor_339"></a><a href="#footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> had been ejected, as we have
   seen, by the agent of the governor, La Barre, from the command of Fort
   St. Louis of the Illinois. An order from the King had reinstated him;
   and he no sooner heard the news of La Salle's landing on the shores of
   the Gulf, and of the disastrous beginnings of his colony,<a name="fnanchor_340" id="fnanchor_340"></a><a href="#footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> than he
   prepared, on his own responsibility and at his own cost, to go to his
   assistance. He collected twenty-five Frenchmen and eleven Indians, and
   set out from his fortified rock on the thirteenth of February, 1686;<a name="fnanchor_341" id="fnanchor_341"></a><a href="#footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
   descended the Mississippi, and reached its mouth in Holy Week. All was
   solitude, a voiceless desolation of river, marsh, and sea. He despatched
   canoes to the east and to the west, searching the coast for some thirty
   leagues on either side. Finding no trace of his friend, who at that moment
   was ranging the prairies of Texas in no less fruitless search of his "fatal
   river," Tonty wrote for him a letter, which he left <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg
   455]</a></span> in the charge of an Indian chief, who preserved it with
   reverential care, and gave it, fourteen years after, to Iberville, the
   founder of Louisiana.<a name="fnanchor_342" id="fnanchor_342"></a><a href="#footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Deeply disappointed at his failure, Tonty retraced
   his course, and ascended the Mississippi to the villages of the Arkansas,
   where some of his men volunteered to remain. He left six of them; and
   of this number were Couture and De Launay.<a name="fnanchor_343" id="fnanchor_343"></a><a href="#footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">A HOSPITABLE RECEPTION.</div>
<p>Cavelier and his companions, followed by a crowd of Indians, some carrying
   their baggage, some struggling for a view of the white strangers, entered
   the log cabin of their two hosts. Rude as it was, they found in it an
   earnest of peace and safety, and a foretaste of home. Couture and De Launay
   were moved even to tears by the story of their disasters, and of the catastrophe
   that crowned them. La Salle's death was carefully concealed from the Indians,
   many of whom had seen him on his descent of the Mississippi, and who regarded
   him with prodigious respect. They lavished all their hospitality on his
   followers; feasted them on corn-bread, dried buffalo meat, and watermelons,
   and danced the calumet before them, the most august of all their ceremonies.
   On this occasion, Cavelier's patience <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg
   456]</a></span> failed him again; and pretending, as before, to be ill,
   he called on his nephew to take his place. There were solemn dances, too,
   in which the warriors&mdash;some bedaubed with white clay, some with red,
   and some with both; some wearing feathers, and some the horns of buffalo;
   some naked, and some in painted shirts of deer-skin, fringed with scalp-locks,
   insomuch, says Joutel, that they looked like a troop of devils&mdash;leaped,
   stamped, and howled from sunset till dawn. All this was partly to do the
   travellers honor, and partly to extort presents. They made objections,
   however, when asked to furnish guides; and it was only by dint of great
   offers that four were at length procured.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE MISSISSIPPI.</div>
<p>With these, the travellers resumed their journey in a wooden canoe, about
   the first of August,<a name="fnanchor_344" id="fnanchor_344"></a><a href="#footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> descended the Arkansas, and soon reached the
   dark and inexorable river, so long the object of their search, rolling,
   like a destiny, through its realms of solitude and shade. They launched
   their canoe on its turbid bosom, plied their oars against the current,
   and slowly won their way upward, following the writhings of this watery
   monster through cane-brake, swamp, and fen. It was a hard and toilsome
   journey, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span> under
   the sweltering sun of August,&mdash;now on the water, now knee-deep in
   mud, dragging their canoe through the unwholesome jungle. On the nineteenth,
   they passed the mouth of the Ohio; and their Indian guides made it an
   offering of buffalo meat. On the first of September, they passed the Missouri,
   and soon after saw Marquette's pictured rock, and the line of craggy heights
   on the east shore, marked on old French maps as "the Ruined Castles." Then,
   with a sense of relief, they turned from the great river into the peaceful
   current of the Illinois. They were eleven days in ascending it, in their
   large and heavy wooden canoe; when at length, on the afternoon of the
   fourteenth of September, they saw, towering above the forest and the river,
   the cliff crowned with the palisades of Fort St. Louis of the Illinois.
   As they drew near, a troop of Indians, headed by a Frenchman, descended
   from the rock, and fired their guns to salute them. They landed, and followed
   the forest path that led towards the fort, when they were met by Boisrondet,
   Tonty's comrade in the Iroquois war, and two other Frenchmen, who no sooner
   saw them than they called out, demanding where was La Salle. Cavelier,
   fearing lest he and his party would lose the advantage they might derive
   from his character of representative of his brother, was determined to
   conceal his death; and Joutel, as he himself confesses, took part in the
   deceit. Substituting equivocation for falsehood, they replied that La
   Salle had been with them nearly <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg
   458]</a></span> as far as the Cenis villages, and that, when they parted,
   he was in good health. This, so far as they were concerned, was, literally
   speaking, true; but Douay and Teissier, the one a witness and the other
   a sharer in his death, could not have said so much without a square falsehood,
   and therefore evaded the inquiry.</p>
<p>Threading the forest path, and circling to the rear of the rock, they
   climbed the rugged height, and reached the top. Here they saw an area,
   encircled by the palisades that fenced the brink of the cliff, and by
   several dwellings, a store-house, and a chapel. There were Indian lodges
   too; for some of the red allies of the French made their abode with them.<a name="fnanchor_345" id="fnanchor_345"></a><a href="#footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
   Tonty was absent, fighting the Iroquois; but his lieutenant, Bellefontaine,
   received the travellers, and his little garrison of bush-rangers greeted
   them with a salute of musketry, mingled with the whooping of the Indians.
   A <i>Te Deum</i> followed at the chapel; "and, with all our hearts," says
   Joutel, "we gave thanks to God, who had preserved and guided us." At length,
   the tired travellers were among countrymen and friends. Bellefontaine
   found a room for the two priests; while Joutel, Teissier, and young Cavelier
   were lodged in the store-house.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE JESUIT ALLOUEZ.</div>
<p>The Jesuit Allouez was lying ill at the fort; and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg
         459]</a></span> Joutel, Cavelier, and Douay went to visit him. He
         showed great anxiety when told that La Salle was alive, and on his
         way to the Illinois; asked many questions, and could not hide his
         agitation. When, some time after, he had partially recovered, he
         left St. Louis, as if to shun a meeting with the object of his alarm.<a name="fnanchor_346" id="fnanchor_346"></a><a href="#footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
         Once before, in 1679, Allouez had fled <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg
         460]</a></span> from the Illinois on hearing of the approach of
         La Salle.</p>
<p>The season was late, and they were eager to hasten forward that they might
   reach Quebec in time to return to France in the autumn ships. There was
   not a day to lose. They bade farewell to Bellefontaine, from whom, as
   from all others, they had concealed the death of La Salle, and made their
   way across the country to Chicago. Here they were detained a week by a
   storm; and when at length they embarked in a canoe furnished by Bellefontaine,
   the tempest soon forced them to put back. On this, they abandoned their
   design, and returned to Fort St. Louis, to the astonishment of its inmates.</p>
<div class="sidenote">CONDUCT OF CAVELIER.</div>
<p>It was October when they arrived; and, meanwhile, Tonty had returned from
   the Iroquois war, where he had borne a conspicuous part in the famous
   attack on the Senecas by the Marquis de Denonville.<a name="fnanchor_347" id="fnanchor_347"></a><a href="#footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> He listened with
   deep interest to the mournful story of his guests. Cavelier knew him well.
   He knew, so far as he was capable of knowing, his generous and disinterested
   character, his long and faithful <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg
   461]</a></span> attachment to La Salle, and the invaluable services he
   had rendered him. Tonty had every claim on his confidence and affection.
   Yet he did not hesitate to practise on him the same deceit which he had
   practised on Bellefontaine. He told him that he had left his brother in
   good health on the Gulf of Mexico, and drew upon him, in La Salle's name,
   for an amount stated by Joutel at about four thousand livres, in furs,
   besides a canoe and a quantity of other goods, all of which were delivered
   to him by the unsuspecting victim.<a name="fnanchor_348" id="fnanchor_348"></a><a href="#footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>
<p>This was at the end of the winter, when the old priest and his companions
   had been living for months on Tonty's hospitality. They set out for Canada
   on <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span> the
   twenty-first of March, reached Chicago on the twenty-ninth, and thence
   proceeded to Michilimackinac. Here Cavelier sold some of Tonty's furs
   to a merchant, who gave him in payment a draft on Montreal, thus putting
   him in funds for his voyage home. The party continued their journey in
   canoes by way of French River and the Ottawa, and safely reached Montreal
   on the seventeenth of July. Here they procured the clothing of which they
   were wofully in need, and then descended the river to Quebec, where they
   took lodging,&mdash;some with the R&eacute;collet friars, and some with
   the priests of the Seminary,&mdash;in order to escape the questions of
   the curious. At the end of August they embarked for France, and early
   in October arrived safely at Rochelle. None of the party were men of especial
   energy or force of character; and yet, under the spur of a dire necessity,
   they had achieved one of the most adventurous journeys on record.</p>
<div class="sidenote">THE COLONISTS ABANDONED.</div>
<p>Now, at length, they disburdened themselves of their gloomy secret; but
   the sole result seems to have been an order from the King for the arrest
   of the murderers, should they appear in Canada.<a name="fnanchor_349" id="fnanchor_349"></a><a href="#footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg

      winter lodges of the now nearly extinct Mandans, though not so high
      in proportion to their width, and built of more solid materials, as
      the rigor of a northern climate requires, bear a general resemblance
      to those of the Cenis.</p>
   <p>The Cenis tattooed their faces and some parts of their bodies, by pricking
      powdered charcoal into the skin. The women tattooed the breasts; and
      this practice was general among them, notwithstanding the pain of the
      operation, as it was thought very ornamental. Their dress consisted
      of a sort of frock, or wrapper of skin, from the waist to the knees.
      The men, in summer, wore nothing but the waist-cloth.</p>

      a letter of the new governor, Denonville, just arrived from France,
      of the landing of La Salle, and the loss of the "Aimable," as recounted
      by Beaujeu, on his return. He immediately went back on foot to Fort

      It was this youth who afterwards uttered the ridiculous defamation

      of La Salle, taken from the lips of Couture, was received by him from
      Cavelier and his companions, during their stay at the Arkansas. Couture

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_346" id="footnote_346"></a><a href="#fnanchor_346"> <span class="label">[346]</span></a> Joutel adds that this was occasioned by "une esp&egrave;ce de

      iii. 500).</p>
   <p>La Salle always saw the influence of the Jesuits in the disasters that
      befell him. His repeated assertion, that they wished to establish themselves
      in the valley of the Mississippi, receives confirmation from a document
      entitled <i>M&eacute;moire sur la proposition &agrave; faire par les
      R. P&egrave;res J&eacute;suites pour la d&eacute;couverte des environs
      de la rivi&egrave;re du Mississipi et pour voir si elle est navigable
      jusqu'&agrave; la mer</i>. It is a memorandum of propositions to be
      made to the minister Seignelay, and was apparently put forward as a
      feeler, before making the propositions in form. It was written after
      the return of Beaujeu to France, and before La Salle's death became
      known. It intimates that the Jesuits were entitled to precedence in
      the valley of the Mississippi, as having first explored it. It affirms
      that <i>La Salle had made a blunder, and landed his colony, not at
      the mouth of the river, but at another place</i>; and it asks permission
      to continue the work in which he has failed. To this end, it petitions
      for means to build a vessel at St. Louis of the Illinois, together
      with canoes, arms, tents, tools, provisions, and merchandise for the
      Indians; and it also asks for La Salle's maps and papers, and for those
      of Beaujeu. On their part, it pursues, the Jesuits will engage to make
      a complete survey of the river, and return an exact account of its
      inhabitants, its plants, and its other productions.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_347" id="footnote_347"></a><a href="#fnanchor_347"> <span class="label">[347]</span></a> Tonty, Du Lhut, and Durantaye came to the aid of Denonville with
      a hundred and eighty Frenchmen, chiefly <i>coureurs de bois</i>, and
      four hundred Indians from the upper country. Their services were highly
      appreciated; and Tonty especially is mentioned in the despatches of
      Denonville with great praise.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_348" id="footnote_348"></a><a href="#fnanchor_348"> <span class="label">[348]</span></a> "Monsieur Tonty, croyant M. de la Salle vivant, ne fit pas de
      difficult&eacute; de luy donner pour environ quatre mille liv. de pelleterie,
      de castors, loutres, un canot, et autres effets."&mdash;Joutel, <i>Journal
      Historique</i>, 349.</p>
   <p>Tonty himself does not make the amount so great: "Sur ce qu'ils m'assuroient
      qu'il &eacute;toit rest&eacute; au Golfe de Mexique en bonne sant&eacute;,
      je les re&ccedil;us comme si &ccedil;'avoit est&eacute; lui mesme et
      luy prestay [<i>&agrave; Cavelier</i>] plus de 700 francs."&mdash;Tonty, <i>M&eacute;moire</i>.</p>
   <p>Cavelier must have known that La Salle was insolvent. Tonty had long
      served without pay. Douay says that he made the stay of the party at
      the fort very agreeable, and speaks of him, with some apparent compunction,
      as "ce brave gentilhomme, toujours ins&eacute;parablement attach&eacute; aux
      int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts du Sieur de la Salle, dont nous luy avons cach&eacute; la
      d&eacute;plorable destin&eacute;e."</p>
   <p>Couture, from the Arkansas, brought word to Tonty, several months after,
      of La Salle's death, adding that Cavelier had concealed it, with no
      other purpose than that of gaining money or supplies from him (Tonty),
      in his brother's name. Cavelier had a letter from La Salle, desiring
      Tonty to give him supplies, and pay him 2,652 livres in beaver. If
      Cavelier is to be believed, this beaver belonged to La Salle.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_349" id="footnote_349"></a><a href="#fnanchor_349"> <span class="label">[349]</span></a> <i>Lettre du Roy &agrave; Denonville, 1 Mai, 1689.</i> Joutel
      must have been a young man at the time of the Mississippi expedition;
      for Charlevoix saw him at Rouen, thirty-five years after. He speaks
      of him with emphatic praise; but it must be admitted that his connivance
      in the deception practised by Cavelier on Tonty leaves a shade on his
      character, as well as on that of Douay. In other respects, everything
      that appears concerning him is highly favorable, which is not the case
      with Douay, who, on one or two occasions, makes wilful misstatements.</p>
   <p>Douay says that the elder Cavelier made a report of the expedition
      to the minister Seignelay. This report remained unknown in an English
      collection of autographs and old manuscripts, whence I obtained it
      by purchase, in 1854, both the buyer and seller being at the time ignorant
      of its exact character. It proved, on examination, to be a portion
      of the first draft of Cavelier's report to Seignelay. It consists of
      twenty-six small folio pages, closely written in a clear hand, though
      in a few places obscured by the fading of the ink, as well as by occasional
      erasures and interlineations of the writer. It is, as already stated,
      confused and unsatisfactory in its statements; and all the latter part
      has been lost. On reaching France, he had the impudence to tell Abb&eacute; Tronson,
      Superior of St. Sulpice, "qu'il avait laiss&eacute; M. de la Salle
      dans un tr&egrave;s-beau pays avec M. de Chefdeville en bonne sant&eacute;."&mdash;<i>Lettre
      de Tronson &agrave; Mad. Fauvel-Cavelier, 29 Nov., 1688.</i></p>
   <p>Cavelier addressed to the King a memorial on the importance of keeping
      possession of the Illinois. It closes with an earnest petition for
      money in compensation for his losses, as, according to his own statement,
      he was completely <i>&eacute;puis&eacute;</i>. It is affirmed in a
      memorial of the heirs of his cousin, Fran&ccedil;ois Plet, that he
      concealed the death of La Salle some time after his return to France,
      in order to get possession of property which would otherwise have been
      seized by the creditors of the deceased. The prudent abb&eacute; died
      rich and very old, at the house of a relative, having inherited a large
      estate after his return from America. Apparently, this did not satisfy
      him; for there is before me the copy of a petition, written about 1717,
      in which he asks, jointly with one of his nephews, to be given possession
      of the seigniorial property held by La Salle in America. The petition
      was refused.</p>
   <p>Young Cavelier, La Salle's nephew, died some years after, an officer
      in a regiment. He has been erroneously supposed to be the same with
      one De la Salle, whose name is appended to a letter giving an account
      of Louisiana, and dated at Toulon, 3 Sept., 1698. This person was the
      son of a naval official at Toulon, and was not related to the Caveliers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COURAGE OF TONTY.</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Henri De Tonty</span>, on his rock of St. Louis, was visited in September by
   Couture and two Indians from the Arkansas. Then, for the first time, he
   heard with grief and indignation of the death of La Salle, and the deceit
   practised by Cavelier. The chief whom he had served so well was beyond
   his help; but might not the unhappy colonists left on the shores of Texas
   still be rescued from destruction? Couture had confirmed what Cavelier
   and his party had already told him, that the tribes south of the Arkansas
   were eager to join the French in an invasion of northern Mexico; and he
   soon after received from the governor, Denonville, a letter informing
   him that war had again been declared against Spain. As bold and enterprising
   as La Salle himself, Tonty resolved on an effort to learn the condition
   of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span> few
   Frenchmen left on the borders of the Gulf, relieve their necessities,
   and, should it prove practicable, make them the nucleus of a war-party
   to cross the Rio Grande, and add a new province to the domain of France.
   It was the revival, on a small scale, of La Salle's scheme of Mexican
   invasion; and there is no doubt that, with a score of French musketeers,
   he could have gathered a formidable party of savage allies from the tribes
   of Red River, the Sabine, and the Trinity. This daring adventure and the
   rescue of his suffering countrymen divided his thoughts, and he prepared
   at once to execute the double purpose.<a name="fnanchor_350" id="fnanchor_350"></a><a href="#footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">TONTY MISREPRESENTED.</div>
<p>He left Fort St. Louis of the Illinois early in December, in a pirogue,
   or wooden canoe, with five Frenchmen, a Shawanoe warrior, and two Indian
   slaves; and, after a long and painful journey, he reached the villages
   of the Caddoes on Red River on the twenty-eighth of March. Here he was
   told that Hiens and his companions were at a village eighty leagues distant;
   and thither he was preparing to go in search of them, when all his men,
   excepting the Shawanoe and one Frenchman, declared themselves disgusted
   with the journey, and refused to follow him. Persuasion was useless, and
   there was no means of enforcing obedience. He found himself abandoned;
   but he still pushed on, with the two who remained faithful. A few days
   after, they lost nearly all their ammunition in crossing a river. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg
   466]</a></span> Undeterred by this accident, Tonty made his way to the
   village where Hiens and those who had remained with him were said to be;
   but no trace of them appeared, and the demeanor of the Indians, when he
   inquired for them, convinced him that they had been put to death. He charged
   them with having killed the Frenchmen, whereupon the women of the village
   raised a wail of lamentation; "and I saw," he says, "that what I had said
   to them was true." They refused to give him guides; and this, with the
   loss of his ammunition, compelled him to forego his purpose of making
   his way to the colonists on the Bay of St. Louis. With bitter disappointment,
   he and his two companions retraced their course, and at length approached
   Red River. Here they found the whole country flooded. Sometimes they waded
   to the knees, sometimes to the neck, sometimes pushed their slow way on
   rafts. Night and day it rained without ceasing. They slept on logs placed
   side by side to raise them above the mud and water, and fought their way
   with hatchets through the inundated cane-brakes. They found no game but
   a bear, which had taken refuge on an island in the flood; and they were
   forced to eat their dogs. "I never in my life," writes Tonty, "suffered
   so much." In judging these intrepid exertions, it is to be remembered
   that he was not, at least in appearance, of a robust constitution, and

   of July, and the Arkansas villages on the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg

   fever. He resumed his journey when it began to abate, and reached his
   fort of the Illinois in September.<a name="fnanchor_351" id="fnanchor_351"></a><a href="#footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A SCENE OF HAVOC.</div>
<p>While the King of France abandoned the exiles of Texas to their fate,
   a power dark, ruthless, and terrible was hovering around the feeble colony
   on the Bay of St. Louis, searching with pitiless eye to discover and tear
   out that dying germ of civilization from the bosom of the wilderness in
   whose savage immensity it lay hidden. Spain claimed the Gulf of Mexico
   and all its coasts as her own of unanswerable right, and the viceroys
   of Mexico were strenuous to enforce her claim. The capture of one of La
   Salle's four vessels at St. Domingo had made known his designs, and in
   the course of the three succeeding years no less than four expeditions
   were sent out from Vera Cruz to find and destroy him. They scoured the
   whole extent of the coast, and found the wrecks of the "Aimable" and the "Belle;" but
   the colony of St. Louis,<a name="fnanchor_352" id="fnanchor_352"></a><a href="#footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> inland and secluded, escaped their search.
   For a time, the jealousy of the Spaniards was lulled to sleep. They rested
   in the assurance that the intruders had perished, when fresh advices from
   the frontier province of New Leon <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg
   469]</a></span> caused the Viceroy, Galve, to order a strong force, under
   Alonzo de Leon, to march from Coahuila, and cross the Rio Grande. Guided
   by a French prisoner, probably one of the deserters from La Salle, they
   pushed their way across wild and arid plains, rivers, prairies, and forests,
   till at length they approached the Bay of St. Louis, and descried, far
   off, the harboring-place of the French.<a name="fnanchor_353" id="fnanchor_353"></a><a href="#footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> As they drew near, no banner
   was displayed, no sentry challenged; and the silence of death reigned
   over the shattered palisades and neglected dwellings. The Spaniards spurred
   their reluctant horses through the gateway, and a scene of desolation
   met their sight. No living thing was stirring. Doors were torn from their
   hinges; broken boxes, staved barrels, and rusty kettles, mingled with
   a great number of stocks of arquebuses and muskets, were scattered about
   in confusion. Here, too, trampled in mud and soaked with rain, they saw
   more than two hundred books, many of which still retained the traces of
   costly bindings. On the adjacent prairie lay three dead bodies, one of
   which, from fragments of dress still clinging to the wasted remains, they
   saw to be that of a woman. It was in vain to question the imperturbable <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg
   470]</a></span> savages, who, wrapped to the throat in their buffalo-robes,
   stood gazing on the scene with looks of wooden immobility. Two strangers,
   however, at length arrived.<a name="fnanchor_354" id="fnanchor_354"></a><a href="#footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Their faces were smeared with paint,
   and they were wrapped in buffalo-robes like the rest; yet these seeming
   Indians were L'Archev&ecirc;que, the tool of La Salle's murderer Duhaut,
   and Grollet, the companion of the white savage Ruter. The Spanish commander,
   learning that these two men were in the district of the tribe called Texas,<a name="fnanchor_355" id="fnanchor_355"></a><a href="#footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
   had sent to invite them to his camp under a pledge of good treatment;
   and they had resolved to trust Spanish clemency rather than endure longer
   a life that had become intolerable. From them the Spaniards learned nearly
   all that is known of the fate of Barbier, Zenobe Membr&eacute;, and their
   companions. Three months before, a large band of Indians had approached
   the fort, the inmates of which had suffered severely from the ravages
   of the small-pox. From fear of treachery, they refused to admit their
   visitors, but received them at a cabin without the palisades. Here the
   French began a trade with them; when suddenly a band of warriors, yelling <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg
   471]</a></span> the war-whoop, rushed from an ambuscade under the bank
   of the river, and butchered the greater number. The children of one Talon,
   together with an Italian and a young man from Paris named Breman, were
   saved by the Indian women, who carried them off on their backs. L'Archev&ecirc;que
   and Grollet, who with others of their stamp were domesticated in the Indian
   villages, came to the scene of slaughter, and, as they affirmed, buried
   fourteen dead bodies.<a name="fnanchor_356" id="fnanchor_356"></a><a href="#footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>
<p> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg
   472]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">THE SURVIVORS.</div>
<p>L'Archev&ecirc;que and Grollet were sent to Spain, where, in spite of
   the pledge given them, they were thrown into prison, with the intention
   of sending them back to labor in the mines. The Indians, some time after
   De Leon's expedition, gave up their captives to the Spaniards. The Italian
   was imprisoned at Vera Cruz. Breman's fate is unknown. Pierre and Jean
   Baptiste Talon, who were now old enough to bear arms, were enrolled in
   the Spanish navy, and, being captured in 1696 by a French ship of war,
   regained their liberty; while their younger brothers and their sister
   were carried to Spain by the Viceroy.<a name="fnanchor_357" id="fnanchor_357"></a><a href="#footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> With respect to the ruffian
   companions of Hiens, the conviction of Tonty that they had been put to
   death by the Indians may have been well founded; but the buccaneer himself
   is said to have been killed in a quarrel with his accomplice Ruter, the
   white savage; and thus in ignominy and darkness died the last embers of
   the doomed colony of La Salle.</p>
<div class="sidenote">FRUIT OF EXPLORATIONS.</div>
<p>Here ends the wild and mournful story of the explorers of the Mississippi.
   Of all their toil and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg
   473]</a></span> sacrifice, no fruit remained but a great geographical
   discovery, and a grand type of incarnate energy and will. Where La Salle
   had ploughed, others were to sow the seed; and on the path which the undespairing
   Norman had hewn out, the Canadian D'Iberville was to win for France a
   vast though a transient dominion.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_350" id="footnote_350"></a><a href="#fnanchor_350"> <span class="label">[350]</span></a> Tonty, <i>M&eacute;moire</i>.</p>
<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_351" id="footnote_351"></a><a href="#fnanchor_351"> <span class="label">[351]</span></a> Two causes have contributed to detract, most unjustly, from Tonty's
      reputation,&mdash;the publication, under his name, but without his
      authority, of a perverted account of the enterprises in which he took
      part; and the confounding him with his brother, Alphonse de Tonty,
      who long commanded at Detroit, where charges of peculation were brought
      against him. There are very few names in French-American history mentioned
      with such unanimity of praise as that of Henri de Tonty. Hennepin finds
      some fault with him; but his censure is commendation. The despatches
      of the governor, Denonville, speak in strong terms of his services
      in the Iroquois war, praise his character, and declare that he is fit
      for any bold enterprise, adding that he deserves reward from the King.
      The missionary, St. Cosme, who travelled under his escort in 1699,
      says of him: "He is beloved by all the <i>voyageurs</i>.... It was
      with deep regret that we parted from him: ... he is the man who best
      knows the country; ... he is loved and feared everywhere.... Your grace
      will, I doubt not, take pleasure in acknowledging the obligations we
      owe him."</p>
   <p>Tonty held the commission of captain; but, by a memoir which he addressed
      to Ponchartrain in 1690, it appears that he had never received any
      pay. Count Frontenac certifies the truth of the statement, and adds
      a recommendation of the writer. In consequence, probably, of this,
      the proprietorship of Fort St. Louis of the Illinois was granted in
      the same year to Tonty, jointly with La Forest, formerly La Salle's
      lieutenant. Here they carried on a trade in furs. In 1699, a royal
      declaration was launched against the <i>coureurs de bois</i>; but an
      express provision was added in favor of Tonty and La Forest, who were
      empowered to send up the country yearly two canoes, with twelve men,
      for the maintenance of this fort. With such a limitation, this fort
      and the trade carried on at it must have been very small. In 1702,
      we find a royal order, to the effect that La Forest is henceforth to
      reside in Canada, and Tonty on the Mississippi; and that the establishment
      at the Illinois is to be discontinued. In the same year, Tonty joined
      D'Iberville in Lower Louisiana, and was sent by that officer from Mobile
      to secure the Chickasaws in the French interest. His subsequent career
      and the time of his death do not appear. He seems never to have received
      the reward which his great merit deserved. Those intimate with the
      late lamented Dr. Sparks will remember his often-expressed wish that
      justice should be done to the memory of Tonty.</p>
   <p>Fort St. Louis of the Illinois was afterwards reoccupied by the French.
      In 1718, a number of them, chiefly traders, were living here; but three
      years later it was again deserted, and Charlevoix, passing the spot,
      saw only the remains of its palisades.</p>

      are described as an agricultural tribe, and were, to all appearance,
      identical with the Cenis. The name Tejas, or Texas, was first applied
      as a local designation to a spot on the river Neches, in the Cenis
      territory, whence it extended to the whole country. (See Yoakum, <i>History

      on minor points he seems to have indulged his fancy.</p>
   <p>The Viceroy of New Spain, in a report to the King, 1690, says that,
      in order to keep the Texas and other Indians of that region in obedience
      to his Majesty, he has resolved to establish eight missions among them.
      He adds that he has appointed as governor, or commander, in that province,
      Don Domingo Teran de los Rios, who will make a thorough exploration
      of it, carry out what De Leon has begun; prevent the further intrusion
      of foreigners like La Salle, and go in pursuit of the remnant of the
      French, who are said still to remain among the tribes of Red River.

<p class="center">EARLY UNPUBLISHED MAPS OF THE MISSISSIPPI AND THE GREAT LAKES.</p>
<p class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Most</span> of the maps described below are to
be found in the D&eacute;p&ocirc;t des Cartes de la Marine et des Colonies, at
Paris. Taken together, they exhibit the progress of western discovery,
and illustrate the records of the explorers.</p>
<p>1. The map of Galin&eacute;e, 1670, has a double title,&mdash;<i>Carte
      du Canada et des Terres d&eacute;couvertes vers le lac Deri&eacute;,
      and Carte du Lac Ontario et des habitations qui l'environnent ensemble
      le pays que Mess<sup>rs.</sup> Dolier et Galin&eacute;e, missionnaires
      du seminaire de St. Sulpice, ont parcouru</i>. It professes to represent
      only the country actually visited by the two missionaries. Beginning
      with Montreal, it gives the course of the Upper St. Lawrence and the
      shores of Lake Ontario, the river Niagara, the north shore of Lake
      Erie, the Strait of Detroit, and the eastern and northern shores of
      Lake Huron. Galin&eacute;e did not know the existence of the peninsula
      of Michigan, and merges Lakes Huron and Michigan into one, under the
      name of "Michigan&eacute;, ou Mer Douce des Hurons." He was also entirely
      ignorant of the south shore of Lake Erie. He represents the outlet
      of Lake Superior as far as the Saut Ste. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg
      476]</a></span> Marie, and lays down the river Ottawa in great detail,
      having descended it on his return. The Falls of the Genesee are indicated,
      as also the Falls of Niagara, with the inscription, "Sault qui tombe
      au rapport des sauvages de plus de 200 pieds de haut." Had the Jesuits
      been disposed to aid him, they could have given him much additional
      information, and corrected his most serious errors; as, for example,
      the omission of the peninsula of Michigan. The first attempt to map
      out the Great Lakes was that of Champlain, in 1632. This of Galin&eacute;e
      may be called the second.</p>
<p>2. The map of Lake Superior, published in the Jesuit Relation of 1670,
   1671, was made at about the same time with Galin&eacute;e's map. Lake
   Superior is here styled "Lac Tracy, ou Sup&eacute;rieur." Though not so
   exact as it has been represented, this map indicates that the Jesuits
   had explored every part of this fresh-water ocean, and that they had a
   thorough knowledge of the straits connecting the three Upper Lakes, and
   of the adjacent bays, inlets, and shores. The peninsula of Michigan, ignored
   by Galin&eacute;e, is represented in its proper place.</p>
<p>3. Three years or more after Galin&eacute;e made the map mentioned above,
   another, indicating a greatly increased knowledge of the country, was
   made by some person whose name does not appear. This map, which is somewhat
   more than four feet long and about two feet and a half wide, has no title.
   All the Great Lakes, through their entire extent, are laid down on it
   with considerable accuracy. Lake Ontario is called "Lac Ontario, ou de
   Frontenac." Fort Frontenac is indicated, as well as the Iroquois colonies
   of the north shore. Niagara is "Chute haute de 120 toises par o&ugrave; le
   Lac Eri&eacute; tombe dans le Lac Frontenac." Lake Erie is "Lac Teiocha-rontiong,
   dit commun&eacute;ment Lac Eri&eacute;." Lake St. Clair is "Tsiketo, ou
   Lac de la Chaudi&egrave;re." Lake Huron is "Lac Huron, ou Mer Douce des
   Hurons." <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span> Lake
   Superior is "Lac Sup&eacute;rieur." Lake Michigan is "Lac Mitchiganong,
   ou des Illinois." On Lake Michigan, immediately opposite the site of Chicago,
   are written the words, of which the following is the literal translation: "The
   largest vessels can come to this place from the outlet of Lake Erie, where
   it discharges into Lake Frontenac [Ontario]; and from this marsh into
   which they can enter there is only a distance of a thousand paces to the
   River La Divine [Des Plaines], which can lead them to the River Colbert
   [Mississippi], and thence to the Gulf of Mexico." This map was evidently
   made after that voyage of La Salle in which he discovered the Illinois,
   or at least the Des Plaines branch of it. The Ohio is laid down with the
   inscription, "River Ohio, so called by the Iroquois on account of its
   beauty, which the Sieur de la Salle descended." (<i>Ante</i>, 32, <i>note</i>.)</p>
<p>4. We now come to the map of Marquette, which is a rude sketch of a portion
   of Lakes Superior and Michigan, and of the route pursued by him and Joliet
   up the Fox River of Green Bay, down the Wisconsin, and thence down the
   Mississippi as far as the Arkansas. The river Illinois is also laid down,
   as it was by this course that he returned to Lake Michigan after his memorable
   voyage. He gives no name to the Wisconsin. The Mississippi is called "Rivi&egrave;re
   de la Conception;" the Missouri, the Pekitanoui; and the Ohio, the Ouabouskiaou,
   though La Salle, its discoverer, had previously given it its present name,
   borrowed from the Iroquois. The Illinois is nameless, like the Wisconsin.
   At the mouth of a river, perhaps the Des Moines, Marquette places the
   three villages of the Peoria Indians visited by him. These, with the Kaskaskias,
   Maroas, and others, on the map, were merely sub-tribes of the aggregation
   of savages known as the Illinois. On or near the Missouri he places the
   Ouchage (Osages), the Oumessourit <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg
   478]</a></span> (Missouris), the Kansa (Kanzas), the Paniassa (Pawnees),
   the Maha (Omahas), and the Pahoutet (Pah-Utahs?). The names of many other
   tribes, "esloign&eacute;es dans les terres," are also given along the
   course of the Arkansas, a river which is nameless on the map. Most of
   these tribes are now indistinguishable. This map has recently been engraved
   and published.</p>
<p>5. Not long after Marquette's return from the Mississippi, another map
   was made by the Jesuits, with the following title: <i>Carte de la nouvelle
   decouverte que les peres Iesuites ont fait en l'ann&eacute;e 1672, et
   continu&eacute;e par le P. Iacques Marquette de la mesme Compagnie accompagn&eacute; de
   quelques fran&ccedil;ois en l'ann&eacute;e 1673, qu'on pourra nommer en
   fran&ccedil;ois la Manitoumie</i>. This title is very elaborately decorated
   with figures drawn with a pen, and representing Jesuits instructing Indians.
   The map is the same published by Thevenot, not without considerable variations,
   in 1681. It represents the Mississippi from a little above the Wisconsin
   to the Gulf of Mexico, the part below the Arkansas being drawn from conjecture.
   The river is named "Mitchisipi, ou grande Rivi&egrave;re." The Wisconsin,
   the Illinois, the Ohio, the Des Moines(?), the Missouri, and the Arkansas
   are all represented, but in a very rude manner. Marquette's route, in
   going and returning, is marked by lines; but the return route is incorrect.
   The whole map is so crude and careless, and based on information so inexact,
   that it is of little interest.</p>
<p>6. The Jesuits made also another map, without title, of the four Upper
   Lakes and the Mississippi to a little below the Arkansas. The Mississippi
   is called "Riuiere Colbert." The map is remarkable as including the earliest
   representation of the Upper Mississippi, based, perhaps, on the reports
   of Indians. The Falls of St. Anthony are indicated by the word "Saut." It
   is possible that the map <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg
   479]</a></span> may be of later date than at first appears, and that it
   may have been drawn in the interval between the return of Hennepin from
   the Upper Mississippi and that of La Salle from his discovery of the mouth
   of the river. The various temporary and permanent stations of the Jesuits
   are marked by crosses.</p>
<p>7. Of far greater interest is the small map of Louis Joliet made and presented
   to Count Frontenac after the discoverer's return from the Mississippi.
   It is entitled <i>Carte de la decouverte du S<sup>r.</sup> Jolliet ou
   l'on voit La Communication du fleuve St. Laurens avec les lacs frontenac,
   Eri&eacute;, Lac des Hurons et Ilinois</i>. Then succeeds the following,
   written in the same antiquated French, as if it were a part of the title: "Lake
   Frontenac [Ontario] is separated by a fall of half a league from Lake
   Eri&eacute;, from which one enters that of the Hurons, and by the same
   navigation, into that of the Illinois [Michigan], from the head of which
   one crosses to the Divine River [Rivi&egrave;re Divine; <i>i. e.</i>,
   the Des Plaines branch of the river Illinois], by a portage of a thousand
   paces. This river falls into the river Colbert [Mississippi], which discharges
   itself into the Gulf of Mexico." A part of this map is based on the Jesuit
   map of Lake Superior, the legends being here for the most part identical,
   though the shape of the lake is better given by Joliet. The Mississippi,
   or "Riuiere Colbert," is made to flow from three lakes in latitude 47&deg;;
   and it ends in latitude 37&deg;, a little below the mouth of the Ohio,
   the rest being apparently cut off to make room for Joliet's letter to
   Frontenac (<i>ante</i>, 76), which is written on the lower part of the
   map. The valley of the Mississippi is called on the map "Colbertie, ou
   Amerique Occidentale." The Missouri is represented without name, and against
   it is a legend, of which the following is the literal translation: "By
   one of these great rivers which come from the west and discharge themselves
   into the river Colbert, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg
   480]</a></span> one will find a way to enter the Vermilion Sea (Gulf of
   California). I have seen a village which was not more than twenty days'
   journey by land from a nation which has commerce with those of California.
   If I had come two days sooner, I should have spoken with those who had
   come from thence, and had brought four hatchets as a present." The Ohio
   has no name, but a legend over it states that La Salle had descended it.
   (See <i>ante</i>, 32, <i>note</i>).</p>
<p>8. Joliet, at about the same time, made another map, larger than that
   just mentioned, but not essentially different. The letter to Frontenac
   is written upon both. There is a third map, of which the following is
   the title: <i>Carte generalle de la France septentrionale contenant la
   descouuerte du pays des Illinois, faite par le S<sup>r</sup>. Jolliet</i>.
   This map, which is inscribed with a dedication by the Intendant Duchesneau
   to the minister Colbert, was made some time after the voyage of Joliet
   and Marquette. It is an elaborate piece of work, but very inaccurate.
   It represents the continent from Hudson's Strait to Mexico and California,
   with the whole of the Atlantic and a part of the Pacific coast. An open
   sea is made to extend from Hudson's Strait westward to the Pacific. The
   St. Lawrence and all the Great Lakes are laid down with tolerable correctness,
   as also is the Gulf of Mexico. The Mississippi, called "Messasipi," flows
   into the Gulf, from which it extends northward nearly to the "Mer du Nord." Along
   its course, above the Wisconsin, which is called "Miskous," is a long
   list of Indian tribes, most of which cannot now be recognized, though
   several are clearly sub-tribes of the Sioux. The Ohio is called "Ouaboustikou." The
   whole map is decorated with numerous figures of animals, natives of the
   country, or supposed to be so. Among them are camels, ostriches, and a
   giraffe, which are placed on the plains west <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg
   481]</a></span> of the Mississippi. But the most curious figure is that
   which represents one of the monsters seen by Joliet and Marquette, painted
   on a rock by the Indians. It corresponds with Marquette's description
   (<i>ante</i>, 68). This map, which is an early effort of the engineer
   Franquelin, does more credit to his skill as a designer than to his geographical
   knowledge, which appears in some respects behind his time.</p>
<p>9. <i>Carte de l'Am&eacute;rique Septentrionale depuis l'embouchure de
      la Rivi&egrave;re St. Laurens jusques au Sein Mexique.</i> On this
      curious little map, the Mississippi is called "Riuiere Buade" (the
      family name of Frontenac); and the neighboring country is "La Frontenacie." The
      Illinois is "Riuiere de la Diuine ou Loutrelaise," and the Arkansas
      is "Riuiere Bazire." The Mississippi is made to head in three lakes,
      and to discharge itself into "B. du S. Esprit" (Mobile Bay). Some of
      the legends and the orthography of various Indian names are clearly
      borrowed from Marquette. This map appears to be the work of Raudin,
      Frontenac's engineer. I owe a tracing of it to the kindness of Henry
      Harrisse, Esq.</p>
<p>10. <i>Carte des Parties les plus occidentales du Canada, par le P&egrave;re
      Pierre Raffeix</i>, S. J. This rude map shows the course of Du Lhut
      from the head of Lake Superior to the Mississippi, and partly confirms
      the story of Hennepin, who, Raffeix says in a note, was rescued by
      Du Lhut. The course of Joliet and Marquette is given, with the legend "Voyage
      et premi&egrave;re descouverte du Mississipy faite par le P. Marquette
      et M<sup>r.</sup> Joliet en 1672." The route of La Salle in 1679, 1680,
      is also laid down.</p>
<p>11. In the D&eacute;p&ocirc;t des Cartes de la Marine is another map of
   the Upper Mississippi, which seems to have been made by or for Du Lhut.
   Lac Buade, the "Issatis," the "Tintons," the "Houelbatons," the "Poualacs," and
   other tribes <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg
   482]</a></span> of this region appear upon it. This is the map numbered
   208 in the <i>Cartographie</i> of Harrisse.</p>
<p>12. Another map deserving mention is a large and fine one, entitled <i>Carte
      de l'Am&eacute;rique Septentrionale et partie de la Meridionale ...
      avec les nouvelles d&eacute;couvertes de la Rivi&egrave;re Missisipi,
      ou Colbert</i>. It appears to have been made in 1682 or 1683, before
      the descent of La Salle to the mouth of the Mississippi was known to
      the maker, who seems to have been Franquelin. The lower Mississippi
      is omitted, but its upper portions are elaborately laid down; and the
      name <i>La Louisiane</i> appears in large gold letters along its west
      side. The Falls of St. Anthony are shown, and above them is written "Armes
      du Roy grav&eacute;es sur cet arbre l'an 1679." This refers to the <i>acte
      de prise de possession</i> of Du Lhut in July of that year, and this
      part of the map seems made from data supplied by him.</p>
<p>13. We now come to the great map of Franquelin, the most remarkable of
   all the early maps of the interior of North America, though hitherto completely
   ignored by both American and Canadian writers. It is entitled <i>Carte
   de la Louisiane ou des Voyages du S<sup>r.</sup> de la Salle et des pays
   qu'il a d&eacute;couverts depuis la Nouvelle France jusqu'au Golfe Mexique
   les ann&eacute;es 1679, <a href="#Page_80">80</a>, 81, et 82, par Jean Baptiste Louis Franquelin,
   l'an 1684. Paris.</i> Franquelin was a young engineer, who held the post
   of hydrographer to the King, at Quebec, in which Joliet succeeded him.
   Several of his maps are preserved, including one made in 1681, in which
   he lays down the course of the Mississippi,&mdash;the lower part from
   conjecture,&mdash;making it discharge itself into Mobile Bay. It appears
   from a letter of the governor, La Barre, that Franquelin was at Quebec
   in 1683, engaged on a map which was probably that of which the title is
   given above, though had La Barre known that it was to be called a map
   of the journeys of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg
   483]</a></span> his victim La Salle, he would have been more sparing of
   his praises. "He" (Franquelin), writes the governor, "is as skilful as
   any in France, but extremely poor and in need of a little aid from his
   Majesty as an Engineer; he is at work on a very correct map of the country,
   which I shall send you next year in his name; meanwhile, I shall support
   him with some little assistance."&mdash;<i>Colonial Documents of New York</i>,
   IX. 205.</p>
<p>The map is very elaborately executed, and is six feet long and four and
   a half wide. It exhibits the political divisions of the continent, as
   the French then understood them; that is to say, all the regions drained
   by streams flowing into the St. Lawrence and the Mississippi are claimed
   as belonging to France, and this vast domain is separated into two grand
   divisions, La Nouvelle France and La Louisiane. The boundary line of the
   former, New France, is drawn from the Penobscot to the southern extremity
   of Lake Champlain, and thence to the Mohawk, which it crosses a little
   above Schenectady, in order to make French subjects of the Mohawk Indians.
   Thence it passes by the sources of the Susquehanna and the Alleghany,
   along the southern shore of Lake Erie, across Southern Michigan, and by
   the head of Lake Michigan, whence it sweeps northwestward to the sources
   of the Mississippi. Louisiana includes the entire valley of the Mississippi
   and the Ohio, besides the whole of Texas. The Spanish province of Florida
   comprises the peninsula and the country east of the Bay of Mobile, drained
   by streams flowing into the Gulf; while Carolina, Virginia, and the other
   English provinces, form a narrow strip between the Alleghanies and the
   Atlantic.</p>
<p>The Mississippi is called "Missisipi, ou Rivi&egrave;re Colbert;" the
   Missouri, "Grande Rivi&egrave;re des Emissourittes, ou Missourits;" the
   Illinois, "Rivi&egrave;re des Ilinois, ou Macopins;" the Ohio, which La
   Salle had before called by its <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg
   484]</a></span> present name, "Fleuve St. Louis, ou Chucagoa, ou Casquinampogamou;" one
   of its principal branches is "Ohio, ou Olighin" (Alleghany); the Arkansas, "Rivi&egrave;re
   des Acansea;" the Red River, "Rivi&egrave;re Seignelay," a name which
   had once been given to the Illinois. Many smaller streams are designated
   by names which have been entirely forgotten.</p>
<p>The nomenclature differs materially from that of Coronelli's map, published
   four years later. Here the whole of the French territory is laid down
   as "Canada, ou La Nouvelle France," of which "La Louisiane" forms an integral
   part. The map of Homannus, like that of Franquelin, makes two distinct
   provinces, of which one is styled "Canada" and the other "La Louisiane," the
   latter including Michigan and the greater part of New York. Franquelin
   gives the shape of Hudson's Bay, and of all the Great Lakes, with remarkable
   accuracy. He makes the Mississippi bend much too far to the West. The
   peculiar sinuosities of its course are indicated; and some of its bends&mdash;as,
   for example, that at New Orleans&mdash;are easily recognized. Its mouths
   are represented with great minuteness; and it may be inferred from the
   map that, since La Salle's time, they have advanced considerably into
   the sea.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting feature in Franquelin's map is his sketch
   of La Salle's evanescent colony on the Illinois, engraved for this volume.
   He reproduced the map in 1688, for presentation to the King, with the
   title <i>Carte de l'Am&eacute;rique Septentrionale, depuis le 25 jusq'au
   65 degr&eacute; de latitude et environ 140 et 235 degr&eacute;s de longitude,
   etc.</i> In this map, Franquelin corrects various errors in that which
   preceded. One of these corrections consists in the removal of a branch
   of the river Illinois which he had marked on his first map,&mdash;as will
   be seen by referring to the portion of it in this book,&mdash;but which
   does not in fact exist. On this <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg
   485]</a></span> second map, La Salle's colony appears in much diminished
   proportions, his Indian settlements having in good measure dispersed.</p>
<p>Two later maps of New France and Louisiana, both bearing Franquelin's
   name, are preserved in the D&eacute;p&ocirc;t des Cartes de la Marine,
   as well as a number of smaller maps and sketches, also by him. They all
   have more or less of the features of the great map of 1684, which surpasses
   them all in interest and completeness.</p>
<p>The remarkable manuscript map of the Upper Mississippi by Le Sueur belongs
   to a period later than the close of this narrative.</p>
<p>These various maps, joined to contemporary documents, show that the Valley
   of the Mississippi received, at an early date, the several names of Manitoumie,
   Frontenacie, Colbertie, and La Louisiane. This last name, which it long
   retained, is due to La Salle. The first use of it which I have observed
   is in a conveyance of the Island of Belleisle made by him to his lieutenant,
   La Forest, in 1679.</p>
<h3><a name="APPENDIX_II" id="APPENDIX_II"></a>II.</h3>
<p class="center">THE ELDORADO OF MATHIEU S&Acirc;GEAN.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Father Hennepin</span> had among his contemporaries two rivals in the fabrication
   of new discoveries. The first was the noted La Hontan, whose book, like
   his own, had a wide circulation and proved a great success. La Hontan
   had seen much, and portions of his story have a substantial value; but
   his account of his pretended voyage up the "Long River" is a sheer fabrication.
   His "Long River" <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg
   486]</a></span> corresponds in position with the St. Peter, but it corresponds
   in nothing else; and the populous nations whom he found on it&mdash;the
   Eokoros, the Esanapes, and the Gnacsitares, no less than their neighbors
   the Mozeemlek and the Tahuglauk&mdash;are as real as the nations visited
   by Captain Gulliver. But La Hontan did not, like Hennepin, add slander
   and plagiarism to mendacity, or seek to appropriate to himself the credit
   of genuine discoveries made by others.</p>
<p>Mathieu S&acirc;gean is a personage less known than Hennepin or La Hontan;
   for though he surpassed them both in fertility of invention, he was illiterate,
   and never made a book. In 1701, being then a soldier in a company of marines
   at Brest, he revealed a secret which he declared that he had locked within
   his breast for twenty years, having been unwilling to impart it to the
   Dutch and English, in whose service he had been during the whole period.
   His story was written down from his dictation, and sent to the minister
   Ponchartrain. It is preserved in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, and
   in 1863 it was printed by Mr. Shea.</p>
<p>He was born, he declares, at La Chine in Canada, and engaged in the service
   of La Salle about twenty years before the revelation of his secret; that
   is, in 1681. Hence, he would have been, at the utmost, only fourteen years
   old, as La Chine did not exist before 1667. He was with La Salle at the
   building of Fort St. Louis of the Illinois, and was left here as one of
   a hundred men under command of Tonty. Tonty, it is to be observed, had
   but a small fraction of this number; and S&acirc;gean describes the fort
   in a manner which shows that he never saw it. Being desirous of making
   some new discovery, he obtained leave from Tonty, and set out with eleven
   other Frenchmen and two Mohegan Indians. They ascended the Mississippi
   a hundred and fifty leagues, carried their canoes by a cataract, went
   forty leagues farther, and stopped a month to hunt. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg
   487]</a></span> While thus employed, they found another river, fourteen
   leagues distant, flowing south-southwest. They carried their canoes thither,
   meeting on the way many lions, leopards, and tigers, which did them no
   harm; then they embarked, paddled a hundred and fifty leagues farther,
   and found themselves in the midst of the great nation of the Acanibas,
   dwelling in many fortified towns, and governed by King Hagaren, who claimed
   descent from Montezuma. The King, like his subjects, was clothed with
   the skins of men. Nevertheless, he and they were civilized and polished
   in their manners. They worshipped certain frightful idols of gold in the
   royal palace. One of them represented the ancestor of their monarch armed
   with lance, bow, and quiver, and in the act of mounting his horse; while
   in his mouth he held a jewel as large as a goose's egg, which shone like
   fire, and which, in the opinion of S&acirc;gean, was a carbuncle. Another
   of these images was that of a woman mounted on a golden unicorn, with
   a horn more than a fathom long. After passing, pursues the story, between
   these idols, which stand on platforms of gold, each thirty feet square,
   one enters a magnificent vestibule, conducting to the apartment of the
   King. At the four corners of this vestibule are stationed bands of music,
   which, to the taste of S&acirc;gean, was of very poor quality. The palace
   is of vast extent, and the private apartment of the King is twenty-eight
   or thirty feet square; the walls, to the height of eighteen feet, being
   of bricks of solid gold, and the pavement of the same. Here the King dwells
   alone, served only by his wives, of whom he takes a new one every day.
   The Frenchmen alone had the privilege of entering, and were graciously
   received.</p>
<p>These people carry on a great trade in gold with a nation, believed by
   S&acirc;gean to be the Japanese, as the journey to them lasts six months.
   He saw the departure of one of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg
   488]</a></span> caravans, which consisted of more than three thousand
   oxen, laden with gold, and an equal number of horsemen, armed with lances,
   bows, and daggers. They receive iron and steel in exchange for their gold.
   The King has an army of a hundred thousand men, of whom three fourths
   are cavalry. They have golden trumpets, with which they make very indifferent
   music; and also golden drums, which, as well as the drummer, are carried
   on the backs of oxen. The troops are practised once a week in shooting
   at a target with arrows; and the King rewards the victor with one of his
   wives, or with some honorable employment.</p>
<p>These people are of a dark complexion and hideous to look upon, because
   their faces are made long and narrow by pressing their heads between two
   boards in infancy. The women, however, are as fair as in Europe; though,
   in common with the men, their ears are enormously large. All persons of
   distinction among the Acanibas wear their fingernails very long. They
   are polygamists, and each man takes as many wives as he wants. They are
   of a joyous disposition, moderate drinkers, but great smokers. They entertained
   S&acirc;gean and his followers during five months with the fat of the
   land; and any woman who refused a Frenchman was ordered to be killed.
   Six girls were put to death with daggers for this breach of hospitality.
   The King, being anxious to retain his visitors in his service, offered
   S&acirc;gean one of his daughters, aged fourteen years, in marriage; and
   when he saw him resolved to depart, promised to keep her for him till
   he should return.</p>
<p>The climate is delightful, and summer reigns throughout the year. The
   plains are full of birds and animals of all kinds, among which are many
   parrots and monkeys, besides the wild cattle, with humps like camels,
   which these people use as beasts of burden.</p>
<p>King Hagaren would not let the Frenchmen go till they <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg
         489]</a></span> had sworn by the sky, which is the customary oath
         of the Acanibas, that they would return in thirty-six moons, and
         bring him a supply of beads and other trinkets from Canada. As gold
         was to be had for the asking, each of the eleven Frenchmen took
         away with him sixty small bars, weighing about four pounds each.
         The King ordered two hundred horsemen to escort them, and carry
         the gold to their canoes; which they did, and then bade them farewell
         with terrific howlings, meant, doubtless, to do them honor.</p>
<p>After many adventures, wherein nearly all his companions came to a bloody
   end, S&acirc;gean, and the few others who survived, had the ill luck to
   be captured by English pirates, at the mouth of the St. Lawrence. He spent
   many years among them in the East and West Indies, but would not reveal
   the secret of his Eldorado to these heretical foreigners.</p>
<p>Such was the story, which so far imposed on the credulity of the minister
   Ponchartrain as to persuade him that the matter was worth serious examination.
   Accordingly, S&acirc;gean was sent to Louisiana, then in its earliest
   infancy as a French colony. Here he met various persons who had known
   him in Canada, who denied that he had ever been on the Mississippi, and
   contradicted his account of his parentage. Nevertheless, he held fast
   to his story, and declared that the gold mines of the Acanibas could be
   reached without difficulty by the river Missouri. But Sauvolle and Bienville,
   chiefs of the colony, were obstinate in their unbelief; and S&acirc;gean
   and his King Hagaren lapsed alike into oblivion.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to quote here from the innumerable tributes to
   so famous an American author as Francis Parkman. Among writers who have
   bestowed the highest praise upon his writings are such names as James
   Russell Lowell, Dr. John Fisk, President Charles W. Eliot of Harvard University,
   George William Curtis, Edward Eggleston, W. D. Howells, James Schouler,
   and Dr. Conan Doyle, as well as many prominent critics in the United States,
   in Canada, and in England.</p>
<p>In two respects Francis Parkman was exceptionally fortunate. He chose
   a theme of the closest interest to his countrymen,&mdash;the colonization
   of the American Continent and the wars for its possession,&mdash;and he
   lived through fifty years of toil to complete his great historical series.</p>
<p>The text of the New Library Edition is that of the latest issue of each
   work prepared for the press by the distinguished author. He carefully
   revised and added to several of his works, not through change of views,
   but in the light of new documentary evidence which his patient research
   and untiring zeal extracted from the hidden archives of the past. Thus
   he rewrote and enlarged "The Conspiracy of Pontiac"; the new edition of "La
   Salle and the Discovery of the Great West" (1878), and the 1885 edition
   of "Pioneers of France" included very important additions; and a short
   time before his death he added to "The Old R&eacute;gime" fifty pages,
   under the title of "The Feudal Chiefs of Acadia." The New Library Edition
   therefore includes each work in its final state as perfected by the historian.
   The indexes have been entirely remade.</p>
